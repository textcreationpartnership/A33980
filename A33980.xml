            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HE who ſpeaketh theſe words, is the great <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> one who had been <hi>in deaths often,</hi> who had been for Chriſt's ſake <hi>killed all the day long</hi> (as he ſpeaks,) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. who <hi>died daily</hi> (as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tells us) yet was not wearied out of his life) and was willing to be dying ſtill; ſo that Chriſt might be <hi>magnified in his body by life or death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.20.</note> And <hi>though he deſired to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi> yet it was upon better <hi>motives</hi> than the <hi>taedium</hi> or <hi>burden</hi> of his dying life, that <hi>he might be with Chriſt, which was beſt of all.</hi>

I ſhall only turn the Text into a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> concluding from <hi>Paul</hi>'s work, and confidence, the duty of all.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>Thoſe who would at death have the Crown of Righteouſneſs, which is laid up for, and which God the Righteous Judge will one day give out unto ſome perſons, muſt fight the good fight, finiſh their courſe, keep the faith, and love the appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and thoſe who do theſe things may know that there is ſuch a Crown of Righteouſneſs laid up for them, which the Righteous Judge will give out to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two Propoſitions put together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which God hath laid up, and will one day give out as a Righteous Judge to ſome amongſt the Sons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it ſhall be given out to ſuch, and ſuch only, as fight the good fight, finiſh their courſe, keep the faith, and love the Appearance of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall diſcourſe them ſeverally, then apply them together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61091:7"/> laid up, and God as a Righteous Judge will one day give out to ſome amongſt the Sons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That this <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> is no other than the <hi>Crown of glory, Eternal life</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> is out of doubt, the Bleſſed ſtate of the Saints in Heaven is ſet out in Scripture unto us under a variety of <hi>Metaphors,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the ſatisfaction of the whole Soul there, and all the powers and faculties of it. It is ſometimes ſet out under the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Feaſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.4.</note> a <hi>Banquet,</hi> ſometimes under the Notion of <hi>ſeeing God,</hi>

                     </gap> 1.12.</note> ſometimes under the Notion of an <hi>Inheritance, immortal, incorruptible,</hi> &amp;c. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Notion of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Crown,</hi> ſometimes under Notions of profit, the <hi>riches of glory,</hi> ſometimes under Notions of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; here it is called a Crown. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. it is called a <hi>Crown of glory,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of life, Jam.</hi> 1.12. But 1. <hi>Why a Crown?</hi> 2. Why is it called a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> 3. <hi>How is it laid up?</hi> 4. <hi>How doth, or ſhall God ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Righteous Judge</hi> in giving it out?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſſibly it is called a Crown with reference to the Combatants in the</hi> Roman <hi>Games,</hi> in which the <hi>Victors</hi> had not only <hi>Prizes</hi> for which they ran, but alſo <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Bays,</hi> or Lawrel, or ſome green things. <hi>If a man ſtrive for Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>he is not crowned except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi> As the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours were enriched with a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a prize for which they ran, or wreſtled, or fought, ſo they were honoured with a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Crown which was ſet on their heads; and thus it lets us know, 1. <hi>That Heaven will be a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61091:7"/> place of great honour and dignity.</hi> 2. <hi>That thoſe who obtain it, muſt ſtrive, fight, wreſtle, and that lawfully</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) yea and they muſt <hi>conquer.</hi> None but the Conquerours in thoſe Games were <hi>crowned.</hi> The conſideration of Heaven as a <hi>Crown,</hi> ought to mind us of our duty, to ſtrive, and fight. It is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an ordinary King's <hi>Crown,</hi> which it may be comes to him by <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but a <hi>Combatants Crown,</hi> which is never put on his head till he be declared <hi>Victor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, This Notion is expreſſive of the <hi>high reward of the Saints in Heaven.</hi> A Crown is the higheſt dignity; hence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo a Kingdom; <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> Thus the Metaphor is uſed, <hi>I am.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our heads</hi> (that is) we have loſt our greateſt honour and dignity. Such ſhall be the honour of all the Saints, it ſhall not be only a <hi>Penny,</hi> a reward of their labour, but it ſhall be a Crown, the higheſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reward, ſuch a one as no Eye hath ſeen, no Ear hath heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to conceive; we can fancy no higher honour and dignity, than that of a <hi>Crown,</hi> and therefore it is expreſſed by that, but it will be no ordinary Crown, but a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Poſſibly it may be thus expreſſed, to ſignifie <hi>the fulneſs of the Saints happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The figure of a Crown lets you know that it incompaſſeth <hi>the whole head,</hi> not a part of it only.<note place="margin">Pſa. 16.11.</note> 
                  <hi>At thy right hand</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt)</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61091:8"/> there are <hi>pleaſures, and a fulneſs of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and that for evermore.</hi> The glory of the Saints in Heaven ſhall incompaſs them as a Crown doth the head. God in this life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth his People with <hi>favour,</hi> as a <hi>ſhield</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh) in the life to come he will <hi>incompaſs them with glory as with a Crown.</hi> In this life we have our good things but in part. <hi>Nemo eſt ex omni parte beatus,</hi> there is ſcarce any to be found, who is every way happy. One hath an head at eaſe, but an aking heart; another hath an heart at eaſe, but an aking head; but in Heaven the Saints ſhall be crowned, perfectly happy, on all ſides bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Qu. <hi>But why is this called a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> not only a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> but a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, Not becauſe it is the <hi>merit</hi> of our <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Our <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is all a rag, a filthy Rag. The next words are enough to Satisfy us as to this, <hi>Which the Lord, the Rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous Judge, will give, to them who love his appearance,</hi> if it be a guilt it is not paid for; nor can it be thought that <hi>the love of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> ſhould be judged a proportionable <hi>price</hi> to a <hi>Crown.</hi> A Crown is a thing above a Purchaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it may be called ſo with reference to <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</hi> By his Righteouſneſs (ſaith the Prophet) or, By <hi>his knowledge ſhall my Righteous Servant juſtify many,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.11. Rom. 8.30.</note> 
                  <hi>for he ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> and <hi>whom he juſtifyed</hi> them he alſo glorifyed (ſaith the Apoſtle:) The

He dyed as well as aſcended, that he might prepare a place for us in thoſe bleſſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Saints Crowns are the Purchaſe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It may be ſo called with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Gods Righteouſneſs,</hi> and that whether we take <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as ſignifying <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi> If we take <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as ſignifying <hi>Juſtice:</hi> If (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful, and juſt,</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, It is alſo a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> That is, the <hi>noble,</hi> and <hi>ample</hi> reward of <hi>our Righteouſneſs.</hi> The reward not of <hi>debt,</hi> but of <hi>grace, Eſtius</hi> would have it called the <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs</hi> becauſe purchaſed or merited by our works, or our Righteouſneſs, but that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.4. much troubleth him;<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Qu. <hi>How is this Crown ſaid to be laid up?</hi>

               <p>I have now done with the firſt Propoſition. I paſs to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That thoſe to whom the Righteous Judge will give this Crown muſt be ſuch who have fought the good fight, Finiſhed their courſe, kept the faith, and who love the appearance of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt inquire into the meaning of all theſe.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is this to fight the good fight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What is this good fight?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What fighting is here meant?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The calling of it the good fight, imports that there are ſome bad fights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a fighting againſt God.</hi> This is a bad fight in all ſenſes. It is that <hi>Rebellion</hi> which <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid is as the ſin of <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> It is the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> againſt the <hi>Creator,</hi> of the <hi>Clay</hi> againſt the <hi>Potter,</hi> of the <hi>Child</hi> againſt the <hi>Father.</hi> It is a bad fight in the nature of it, and it is alwaies bad in the iſſue of it. It is a <hi>ſetting of briars and thorns againſt God in battel, a kicking againſt the pricks,</hi> (as our Lord told <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.) yet the world was alwaies full of <hi>Hectors,</hi> hardy enough to engage in this fight; there are ſuch as are fighters againſt God, and indeed all ſinners are ſuch in heart, though they ſome of them keep their hands in their pockets; but ſuch Perſecutors, and ſuch as ſet themſelves in oppoſition to the Goſpel, and the Intereſt of God in the world, in oppoſition to the Truth, and True Worſhip and Ordinances
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61091:10"/> of God; ſuch as ſet themſelves againſt a Goſpel-Miniſtry, and againſt Holineſs; theſe are all fighters againſt God. This now is the bad fight, materially bad, and what will be found ſo <hi>Eventually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is alſo a <hi>fighting againſt men on ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil accounts,</hi> which is a <hi>bad fight;</hi> indeed moſt Wars are ſo (at leaſt on one ſide.) Wars are <hi>State Phyſick,</hi> and when they are ſo uſed and made they are good, otherwiſe they are bad. In all Wars, one Army is made up of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers: Both ſides cannot be right. We are commanded to <hi>ſeek Peace, and inſue it, as much as in us lieth to have peace with all men.</hi> Wars are not to be uſed as ſports. The word which is here tranſlated <hi>good,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>fair, wholeſom, noble, excellent.</hi> Thus you read of the Tree that bringeth forth <hi>good</hi> fruit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17. And Chriſt ſaith, that the woman which had ſpent her <hi>box</hi> of <hi>Ointment</hi> upon him, had done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a good work, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.10. that is, an excellent, noble, praiſe-worthy work, as our Saviour in the next words expounds himſelf, ſaying, <hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Goſpel ſhould be preached, that which ſhe had done ſhould be told for a memorial of her.</hi> But what is this <hi>good fight</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he had fought? He expoundeth himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith. Faith</hi> is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant grace, it is that by which we get the Victory. But who are the Enemies with which this <hi>good fight</hi> is to be <hi>fought?</hi> Who can they be but the three great Enemies of our Souls the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil? Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61091:10"/> fought them all, and ſo muſt every one fight them all, who will put in his claim to the <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He muſt manage his good fight againſt the World;</hi> the men of it, and the things of it. <hi>Paul</hi> had fought this good fight, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. he fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men,</hi> and he telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. he had <hi>had ſtripes above meaſure,</hi> he had been <hi>in Priſons frequent, in deaths often; five times he had of the Jews received forty ſtripes ſave one; thrice</hi> he was <hi>beaten with Rods; once</hi> he was <hi>ſtoned;</hi> all this in maintenance and defence of the Goſpel. Thus muſt every Chriſtian duly of God called to it, do in defence of the holy Truths and Waies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The World, the Men of the World were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies peeviſh to God's holy ones. Our Saviour giveth us the reaſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>becauſe they are not of the world,</hi> but <hi>God hath choſen them out of the world.</hi> Wiſdom was never juſtified in the world of any more than her Children. Now thoſe who ever hope to come in the Kingdom of Heaven, muſt look to manage this part of the <hi>good fight,</hi> not fearing thoſe who can kill the body, and when they have done that; can do no more, but fearing him alone, who can caſt body and ſoul into Hell fire; taking up their Croſs, and following of Chriſt, bearing up againſt all the oppoſition the world can give or make againſt them, walking according to the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this <hi>good fight</hi> is not onely to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61091:11"/> managed againſt the men of the world, ſetting themſelves in oppoſition to the Truths and Waies of God; but alſo againſt the <hi>things of the world,</hi> the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of <hi>pleaſures, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> whatſoever may be to us a bait alluring us to ſin againſt God. <hi>Moſes</hi> by Faith did fight the <hi>World</hi> in this manner, refuſing the pleaſures of <hi>Pharaoh's Court,</hi> and <hi>chuſing rather to ſuffer with the People of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; and eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures in</hi> Egypt. But indeed this rather belongs to the ſecond piece of the <hi>good fight</hi> which is to be managed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Againſt our own Luſts.</hi> By luſts we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe motions, and inclinations, to ſin which are from our fleſhly part, for <hi>Luſts</hi> are nothing but <hi>unlawful deſires</hi> in our Souls. <hi>Paul</hi> fought this part of the good fight, he tells us,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23</note> That <hi>he ſaw a law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind and bringing him into captivity to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> And again, <hi>That the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, for thoſe two are contrary. Paul</hi> fought this part of the <hi>good fight,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body and bring it unto Subjection.</hi> This is, that <hi>Mortifying of our members,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Ccl.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifying the deeds of the body through the Spirit</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that <hi>Fleſhly luſts war againſt the Soul,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and <hi>James</hi> tells us that <hi>Luſt war in our members, James</hi> 4.1. <hi>Paul</hi> fought this part of the good fight, and overcame; <hi>I thank God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61091:11"/> this is the hardeſt battel that a Chriſtian hath to fight the Enemy is within, thoſe of his own houſe and all the advantage which either the World, or the Devil hath againſt us is from that party of luſts which are in our own hearts. Though the Prince of the World came againſt Chriſt, yet finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature in our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> he could do nothing againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our third great adverſary is <hi>the Devil.</hi> For we (faith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>) Eph. 6.12. <hi>Do not wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, and powers, and the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World.</hi> The Devil is called the <hi>adverſary</hi> and the Apoſtle telleth us, that he goeth about like a roaring Lyon ſeeking whom he may devour, and calleth upon us to <hi>Reſiſt him.</hi> He fighteth us ſometimes by his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi> and <hi>under-officers,</hi> thoſe are the ſinful men of the World; ſometimes he fights us in perſon, by his more <hi>immediate impreſſions</hi> and Suggeſtions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan ſent to buffet him,</hi> for which thing he prayed thrice, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Chriſtian hath yet a fourth Enemy; That is <hi>Death.</hi> I ſhould not have called Death an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but that I find the Apoſtle ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The laſt Enemy that is to be deſtroyed is Death.</hi> And indeed our fleſh ſaith both concerning <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Trials of afflictions</hi> leading to it; All <hi>theſe things are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</hi> There is a victorious Song which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Chriſtian muſt learn to ſing, O <hi>Death where is thy ſting?

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61091:12"/> Thus now I have ſhewed you the Enemies to be fought in this good fight.</p>
               <p>The word tranſlated <hi>fight</hi> is a very Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The word ſeemeth to ſignify four things, 1. A <hi>labouring againſt oppoſition.</hi> A man cannot fight unleſs he hath an Enemy to <hi>fight</hi> againſt. What theſe Enemies are I have ſhewed you. 2. <hi>A ſtrong vehement, earneſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> where all the ſtrength, and power of a man is put out, as is uſual in all combates, and fightings, 3. An <hi>inward labour,</hi> from this word comes our Engliſh word <hi>Agony</hi> which we uſe to ſignify the conflict of the mind, and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more then the Scuffling of the hands and more exterior members: Thus it ſignifieth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Labouring fervently for you</hi> in <hi>Prayer.</hi> 4. It ſignifieth <hi>a ſtrife for maſtery,</hi> ſuch as were the ſtrifes in the <hi>Roman games,</hi> where the ſtrife was who ſhould overcome, and have the Victory. It is obſerved by <hi>Aquinas</hi> that the <hi>fight</hi> is called a <hi>good fight</hi> becauſe it is for <hi>good things,</hi> and in a <hi>good manner</hi> and <hi>becauſe it is difficult</hi> and the Apoſtle telleth us, that he who ſtriveth is not crowned except he ſtrive lawfully. Thus I have opened the firſt thing requiſite for him who would have the Crown of Righteouſneſs; he muſt <hi>fight</hi> the <hi>good fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second condition required of thoſe, who expect this Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61091:12"/> to be given them is <hi>their finiſhing their courſe.</hi> I <hi>have</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>finiſhed my courſe,</hi> or my <hi>race.</hi> There is nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in Scripture, then for a <hi>ſeries</hi> or <hi>courſe of actions</hi> to be <hi>called a way.</hi> Thus we read of the <hi>way of God,</hi> the way of the wicked and the <hi>way of the righteous. Holineſs</hi> is called a <hi>way,</hi> the way of God's Commandments, and the exerciſes of Holineſs are a Chriſtian's <hi>walking</hi> or <hi>running</hi> in this way in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of holy Writ. <hi>John fulfilled his courſe, Acts.</hi> 13.25. <hi>Neither</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>do I count my life dear to me ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> It is the ſame with that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do.</hi> This <hi>courſe</hi> muſt not be only entred, and ſome Progreſs made in it, but it muſt be <hi>finiſhed</hi> and brought to an end. If any mans ſoul draw back Gods ſoul will have no pleaſure in him. We muſt not only <hi>begin to run well,</hi> but we muſt take heed that nothing <hi>hindereth us,</hi> or turneth us back; it is <hi>he who indureth to the end, that ſhall be ſaved:</hi> He that draweth back doth it to deſtruction. Every Chriſtian hath a double <hi>courſe,</hi> both muſt be finiſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>his more general courſe,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with all <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> this lieth in the diſcharge of thoſe duties which concern him as a <hi>Creature,</hi> with reference to God as his <hi>Creator,</hi> or as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> with reference to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his <hi>Redeemer.</hi> There is a great deal of ſuch common duty, which belongeth to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one under theſe circumſtances. Thus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61091:13"/> every one is obliged to the Commandments of God reſpecting all his creatures; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt reſpecting them as bought with a price. This is that courſe which <hi>David</hi> promiſeth God <hi>to run, when God ſhould inlarge his heart;</hi> and we are commanded to <hi>run, ſo as we may obtain,</hi> This St. <hi>Paul ran not incertainly, not as one that did beat the Air.</hi> This, to note the certainty and ſteadineſs of our indeavours, is compared to a <hi>walk,</hi> to denote the <hi>alacrity,</hi> and <hi>chearfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi> of our ſpirits to it, is compared to a <hi>Race;</hi> we are not to ſit ſtill and take our reſt, nor to move ſlowly, but to run, <hi>making haſt,</hi> and <hi>not delaying</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) to keep God's Precepts; <hi>preſſing hard after God,</hi> as he in another place expreſſeth it; <hi>forgetting what is behind,</hi> and <hi>preſſing forward to what is before,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to his <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second is a Chriſtians <hi>more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſe,</hi> which comprehendeth thoſe actions of a man which are by the law of God his duty, as fixed in ſuch, or ſuch an Orb, and clothed with ſuch or ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thus <hi>Pauls</hi> courſe was his duty as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and a <hi>Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Another mans courſe is his duty as a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or in any degree of Superiority to others, for there is no Relation but hath a particular duty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, and he muſt <hi>finiſh his courſe</hi> with reference to that. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to both, both his duties as a Chriſtian and his duty as an Apoſtle The Chriſtians reward in heaven is ſometimes compared to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61091:13"/> a <hi>Crown,</hi> and a <hi>Victory,</hi> to let us know that we muſt <hi>fight</hi> for it, ſometimes to a <hi>reſt,</hi> to teach us that we muſt <hi>labour</hi> for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a <hi>mark,</hi> a <hi>goal</hi> a <hi>prize,</hi> to let us know that we muſt <hi>run</hi> if we will obtain, and ſo <hi>run</hi> that we may <hi>obtain, ſtriving</hi> after <hi>Perfection</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.) the finiſhing of our courſe ſignify the two things. 1. <hi>That we muſt do the whole work which God hath given us to do.</hi> 2. <hi>That we muſt not give over until it be all done,</hi> we muſt not be weary of well doing, the promiſe of <hi>Victory</hi> is to him who <hi>overcometh,</hi> the promiſe of <hi>reaping</hi> is to him that is not weary, that fainteth not. Thus I have opened the 2d thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Qu. What is meant hy keeping the faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing is <hi>keeping the faith.</hi> I have (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) kept the faith.</hi> The term <hi>faith</hi> ſignifies ſeveral things in holy Writ. But there are three more famous, and uſual acceptions of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes it is of the ſame import with <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> Rom. 3.3. <hi>ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?</hi> That is, the <hi>faithfulneſs of God.</hi> Gods truth to his word, his faithfulneſs to his promiſe; ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. where Chriſt chargeth the Phariſees for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the great things of the law Judgment Mercy, and Faith, while they were ſtrict as to little things, but I ſhall not inlarge on this which I do not take to be any part of the ſenſe of this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> in Scripture doth very often ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the <hi>Doctrine of faith.</hi> Thus you read, <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61091:14"/> 6.7.<note place="margin">Acts 6.7.</note> 
                  <hi>a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith:</hi> That is, to the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us Prophecy, according to the Proportion of faith,</hi> that is, of our <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of faith.</hi> I take this to be a great part of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of theſe words; <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere ſpeaketh of the Goſpel as of a thing <hi>committed to his truſt,</hi> now ſaith he, I <hi>have kept the faith.</hi> He had kept his own heart from erring, or warping as to it, and he had <hi>kept</hi> it ſo as he had not ſuffered corruptions as to it to break in, and prevail upon thoſe Churches, which he had planted, or which had been under his watering, he had kept it <hi>perſonally,</hi> ſo that in his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had not warped from it, and he had kept it <hi>miniſterially,</hi> keeping others <hi>in the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> This was a piece of his <hi>good fight</hi> and a <hi>piece of his courſe</hi> as a <hi>Miniſter.</hi> And this muſt be the buſineſs of a Chriſtian, <hi>contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly for the faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> 
                  <hi>which was once delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> ſometimes ſignifieth the <hi>habit,</hi> and <hi>grace of faith:</hi> That power of the Soul by which it either giveth a fixed, and ſteady aſſent to the Propoſition of the Goſpel: or receiveth, committeth it ſelf unto, reſteth upon the Perſon of the Mediator, which in Scripture is called a <hi>believing in him,</hi> and <hi>in his name.</hi> Thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> often uſeth it, <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God,</hi> and ſo in a multitude of other texts in holy Writ. This that Chriſtian that hopes for the <hi>Crown of righteouſneſs</hi> muſt alſo keep, he muſt dye <hi>in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61091:14"/> the faith,</hi> not only <hi>ſteadily aſſenting</hi> to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, but in a <hi>ſteady affiance</hi> and recumbency upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is now the third condition annexed to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the <hi>Crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> The 4th is a <hi>loving of Chriſts appearing.</hi> Here ariſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What appearing is here meant?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>What</hi> is <hi>this</hi> to <hi>love the appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Orginal word here tranſlated <hi>appearing,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifieth a bright, and glorious appearance, it is uſed to expreſs Chriſts firſt coming into the world, his manifeſtation in the fleſh,—<hi>But is now made manifeſt by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. That firſt coming of his was attended with a great deal of <hi>glory,</hi> proclaimed by <hi>Angels,</hi> uſhered in by a Meſſenger, ſent as an harbinger before his face to <hi>prepare his way,</hi> declared by a new Star conducting the wiſe men from the eaſt to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and then to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to inquire for him. But the glory of his firſt appearing was not like the glory which ſhall attend his ſecond coming, when <hi>he ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of an Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and with the trump of God,</hi> 1 Theſſal. 4.26. <hi>with ten thouſands of his Saints, Jud.</hi> 14. This is by the Apoſtle called a <hi>glorious appearance as,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whether his firſt or ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing be here meant I doubt. If it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the firſt, the ſenſe is much the ſame
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61091:15"/> with that, <hi>Rejoicing in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in oppoſition to an <hi>having a confidence in the fleſh,</hi> mentioned 3 <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. In this ſenſe the loving his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the loving of him, as <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> the accepting, and receiving of him, as our Saviour and the Mediator betwixt God and man, a breathing after him, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him: if we underſtand it of the latter, that <hi>appearing</hi> of Chriſt which is yet to come, we ſhall further open the duty by opening the 2d thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What this is to love his appearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Love is nothing elſe but a pleaſant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul of man towards an Object, by which diſcerning ſome goodneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it, it takes a ſecret <hi>complacency in the meditations,</hi> and <hi>ſpeculations of it:</hi> By deſire moves toward it, if it hath not obtained a full fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enjoyment of it, and rejoyceth, and delighteth in it if it have. A love towards the <hi>ſecond appearing of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> cannot at preſent diſcover it ſelf in the imbraces of joy, and delight by which love in a Soul, diſcovers it ſelf to an object to which it is united, but only. 1. <hi>In deſires after it</hi> while the Soul crieth out, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt!</hi> or rather <hi>come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> 2. In a joy <hi>and delight</hi> ariſing from the certain belief, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and contemplation of a thing yet fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is a <hi>rejoycing of hope</hi> as well as of <hi>fruition,</hi> for hope (eſpecially that hope which is the daughter of that faith which is the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen</hi>) giveth the Soul an <hi>union</hi> (though of the loweſt degree) with its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61091:15"/> and ſo is productive of a <hi>proportionable joy.</hi> Now my text ſaith, that for all thoſe who thus fight the <hi>good fight, finiſh their courſe, keep the faith,</hi> and love the <hi>appearance of Chriſt,</hi> there is laid up a Crown of righteouſneſs which the Lord, <hi>the righteous judge,</hi> will in that day <hi>give out. In that day;</hi> there is another little queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what <hi>that day</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the day of death. Paul</hi> indeed had been ſpeaking in the verſe before of the <hi>time of his departure,</hi> which he had told us was <hi>at hand,</hi> and it is certain that at the day of death the Souls of believers do immediately paſs into glory but yet this ſeemeth not to be the day here mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Rather the day of <hi>Chriſts ſecond appearing, Emphatically</hi> called <hi>that day,</hi> becauſe there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was nor ever will be any day like unto <hi>that day,</hi> the People of God ſhall in the day of their departure, be taken into glory, that is, their Souls ſhall, but their bodies reſt in their graves until that day, ſo as the glory of the Saints before <hi>that day,</hi> the day of Chriſts coming to Judgment, ſhall be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but in that day they ſhall be Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>If any man asketh from whence this ſhall be, the text gives us a double account of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In ſaying it ſhall be given,</hi> it is not the price of our combate, but it is the conſequent of it from the free grace and gift of God. <hi>The gift of God</hi> is <hi>eternal life,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>Fear not little flock</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>it is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will to give you a kingdom.</hi> My ſheep faith
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61091:16"/> he, hear my voice, and <hi>follow me, and I give unto them eternal life.</hi> The Lord hath given Chriſt power over all fleſh, that he ſhould <hi>give eternal life</hi> to whomſoever he pleaſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The text calls it a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſaith <hi>the righteous judge will give it.</hi> God in all his acts of grace hath a care to declare his righteouſneſs. In the juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he ſo declareth his grace that he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.26, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt <hi>whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins that are paſt through the forbearance of God: To declare, I ſay, at this time his Righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> So in the glorifying of Souls God will not act only as a gracious God, rich in mercy, communicating his goodneſs to his creatures, but he will alſo act as a <hi>righteous judge,</hi> in his giving out of <hi>the Crowns of glory</hi> he hath ſo ordered things that they are alſo crowns, as of glory, and favour, ſo of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> 1. Of <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> being the price, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and of the <hi>Fathers Righteouſneſs</hi> as it is but a <hi>juſt and righteous thing, that</hi> he ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> and fulfil the eternal contract made with the Son of his love, and it is alſo a <hi>righteous thing</hi> that God ſhould fulfil his promiſes of life, made to them who believe in him whom God hath ſent, and be obedient to his Commandments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reaſonableneſs and Righteouſneſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61091:16"/> of God in giving out of this crown then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>from Gods deſignation, Covenant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> The Crown of Righteouſneſs is Chriſts to give, he hath purchaſed it, the Father hath given it to his diſpoſal; and he hath ſo willed, that thoſe who have it ſhould firſt fight for it, firſt run the race and courſe which he hath in his word lined out for them. The promiſes of the <hi>new</hi> name, the white ſtone, the hidden manna are all made unto thoſe who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, thoſe who will obtain muſt run, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a great relation between a <hi>fight,</hi> a <hi>conqueſt,</hi> and a <hi>crown;</hi> I obſerved to you before that the promiſes of Heaven are made to ſuch as overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.12. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. There is a relation alſo betwixt running in a race, and getting of the prize, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. Again, there is always a relation betwixt the means, and the end.

But I have ſpoken enough Doctrinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſhall now come to the application of this diſcourſe.</p>

This God muſt give as a King, the <hi>reward</hi> is too great for us to conceive, too great for us to receive, only it is not too great for God to give, which of us can think any more of merit when he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reward of Heaven called a <hi>Crown?</hi> The notion of a <hi>Crown</hi> ſets it above the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of merit.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Had it been only a Crown of <hi>grace</hi> and favour we might have doubted concerning it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould have been ours or no. But it being a Crown of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> we cannot doubt our one day wearing of it without call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, and Righteouſneſs of God in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a Crown <hi>laid up, prepared for us,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour, Math.</hi> 25. <hi>Laid up</hi> for us (ſaith

And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> God hath bleſſed them and they ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly to put us out of all doubt by reaſon of the diſproportion of our works, when we have done our moſt to this reward it is ſaid, <hi>The righteous judge ſhall give it.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all our <hi>fighting</hi> the good <hi>fight,</hi> running the race, keeping the faith, there is yet a room for a <hi>gift</hi> in the diſpoſal of this Crown to the Saints; where there is no purchaſe nor any natural claim, what can give us a title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſave only <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs?</hi> If it be righteous for God to give it, becauſe Chriſt hath purchaſed, and God hath promiſed, yet God was <hi>free</hi> as to the promiſe, and free in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to us the purchaſe of another.

And of their bodies &amp; ſouls in the reſurrection from the dead. Their reaſonable nature will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to think of an annihilation in death; they cannot think that their ſouls melt into air, &amp; abhor the thoughts of an eternal miſery, ſo as certainly their anſwer would be, <hi>We hope to be ſaved,</hi> we hope for a <hi>Crown of glory, of life,</hi> and <hi>immortality, which God will give us;</hi> but <hi>can a ruſh grow up without mire?

               <p>Ah how many are there that fight indeed, but is it the good fight? They are fighters againſt God, oppoſers of his intereſt, they would (if poſſible) root the very name of of God, and profeſſion of Godlineſs out of the world. They have ſuch an antipathy to piety, that (as they ſay of the <hi>Baſilisk</hi>) it hath ſuch an emnity to man that it will fly upon his picture: ſo they have ſuch an enmity to Chriſt, and holineſs that they fly upon any Perſons, or things who have any thing of Chriſts Image and Superſcription upon them: others are <hi>fighters,</hi> great diſturbers of humane ſocieties with their quarrels. But now for the <hi>good fight</hi> which is to be managed againſt our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; <hi>exorbitant affections, and all the motions of the Soul,</hi> that are contrary to the will of God, how few of thoſe are to be found that fight

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>3</label> of this diſcourſe to enter into our own Souls and to commune with our own hearts,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61091:20"/> inquiring whether we be ſuch Perſons as when we ſhall be ready to dye, &amp; ſhall by any Providence of God be made apprehenſive that the <hi>time of our departure is at hand,</hi> ſhall be able to ſay that <hi>henceforth there is laid up for us a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge ſhall in that day give out to all ſuch, as love the appearance of our Lord, and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> To ſatisfy us as to theſe things, we have heard in the explication of this text that we have ſeveral things to inquire upon, they may be reduced to ſix or ſeven heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What oppoſition we have made</hi> to <hi>the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires and motions of our own hearts contrary to the revealed will of God.</hi> You ſhall obſerve, that a ſinful walking in holy Writ is very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily expreſſed by a walking <hi>according to the counſels,</hi> and <hi>imaginations of our own hearts;</hi> ſo contrary are the natural deſires, counſels, and imaginations of the heart of man to the revealed will of God, there is no ſurer ſign of a wicked man, then for him to walk after his own imaginations or for him (to uſe <hi>Jobs</hi> expreſſion) to ſuffer <hi>his heart</hi> to <hi>walk after his Eyes.</hi> Hence <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> is by our Saviour made the condition, and character, of being one of his diſciples, and we are often in Scripture Commanded to <hi>mortify our members,</hi> and the <hi>deeds of our bodies.</hi> This kind of converſation, which lyeth in the gratifying of our ſenſitive appetites, is the <hi>broad way,</hi> in which many walk, but it is the high way to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What oppoſition we have made to the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61091:20"/> the men of the world, or the things of it, attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to frown, or flatter us out of the duty which we owe unto God.</hi> He who is at the worlds beck cannot be at the Command of Chriſt. If we be the Servants of men we cannot be the Servants of God. As Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, ſo neither did he pleaſe the men of the age wherein he lived in their oppoſitions to the will of his Father. It is moſt certain that the generality of the men of the world love no Child of God as ſuch, they are two different ſeeds betwixt which there ever was, and ever will be an emnity. If they take us by the chin, and kiſs us, it is but that they may have the better opportunity to ſmite us under the fifth rib. The truth is their open war is better than their diſſembled amity, but that alſo requires in us <hi>wiſdom,</hi> when to oppoſe ſo as not to ſuffer as evil doers, and courage and reſolution that we may be able to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How we walk as to our more general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> It is certainly a true ſaying, <hi>grande eſt Chriſtianum eſſe, non dici.</hi> It is a great thing, not to be called, but to be a Chriſtian, and in Chriſtianity, <hi>Tantum es, quantum agis,</hi> a man is juſt ſo much as he acteth in an uniform obedience, having a regard to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. He that wilfully break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any of Gods Commadments is guilty of all, for there is the ſame <hi>reverence</hi> due to God as to one Precept as unto another. We have alſo further to enquire,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>How we diſcharge the duties of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61091:21"/> Relations.</hi> Not only how we run that race, which we have to run in Common with others, but that particular courſe which God hath ſet us, how we have managed our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as parents, Children, Husbands, Wives, Maſters, Servants, Magiſtrates or Subjects, Miniſters or People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What ſteadineſs wee keep as to the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> It is true every warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in opinion from the truth is not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but we muſt take heed of warping in ſuch points as a warping in is inconſiſtent with the exerciſe of <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith.</hi> I will not undertake punctually to determine what things are to be believed upon pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I am ſure every one that doth not <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe in,</hi> or cloſe with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in an ill condition, and from thence it follows, that ſuch opinions drank in, as hinder the exerciſe of <hi>repentance or faith,</hi> muſt needs be pernicious unto Souls.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>What particular faith and dependance we keep up in God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Scriptures are ſo full of texts giving teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the neceſſity of faith in Chriſt in order to eternal ſalvation, that I need not inſtance in many, ſee <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 36. the Scripture ſaith expreſly, that <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> God hath made an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt faith in the Mediator, in him whom God hath ſent, and eternal life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; this indeed cannot be without obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but faith and obedience are two things, and muſt neither be ſeparated, nor confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61091:21"/>7. Laſtly, <hi>What love have we to</hi> the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> How Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance is the object of our love, and wherein our <hi>love to it</hi> is diſcernable, I have already opened.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This notion affords a great deal <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> of conſolation to every good Chriſtian, and that in two caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning all the labours, &amp; difficulties, &amp; preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life.</hi> The good Chriſtian you have deſcribed in the text. He is one <hi>who fighteth the good fight,</hi> who not only runneth but <hi>finiſheth his courſe,</hi> who not only <hi>receiveth but keeps the faith, &amp;c.</hi> The labours of ſuch perſons, their difficulties, their preſſures are uſually not a few, not light, but yet they are not ſuch but a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Crown of life,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> will compenſate. Let them therefore keep their Eye upon the <hi>recompenſe of reward, Jacobs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a <hi>Rachel</hi> made his fourteen years hard ſervice ſeem to him but as a few days. What ſhould the proſpect of this mighty reward, this glorious crown do? The Apoſtle hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thoughts upon the <hi>exceeding weight of glory,</hi> calls the <hi>afflictions of this life light and momentany.</hi> Let this crown promiſed in the text alleviate all our troubles, if we ſuffer from God, or for God, how little muſt it be to him that conſiders he ſhall alſo be glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It relieveth us againſt all our doubts, and fears, about our eternal ſtate,</hi> the promiſe is made to, <hi>pious affections</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> not to <hi>Spiritual enjoyments;</hi> a man may love both the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61091:22"/> 
                  <hi>firſt, and ſecond appearance of Chriſt,</hi> he may <hi>fight the good fight, finiſh his courſe, keep the faith,</hi> and yet <hi>walk in the dark and ſee no</hi> light, but be troubled with his own dark, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick thoughts, moleſted with Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, want the witneſſings of the Spirit with his Spirit. The promiſe is not made to thoſe who here enjoy much of God, but to thoſe who love God, to thoſe, who do, and ſuffer much for God. We have therefore to uphold our hopes nothing to inquire upon, but the faithful diſcharge of our duty, and then to believe that he is faithful who hath promiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>5</label> Fifthly, Let this ingage us all to the duty of the text. Let others be ingaged in the <hi>bad fights</hi> of <hi>the world,</hi> let them if they will be found <hi>fighters againſt</hi> God, againſt his truths, ways, ordinances, people, his intereſt and whole concern in the world, let others be finiſhing their courſes of ſin and wickedneſs till their ſins being finiſhed ſhall bring forth death. Let others be ingaged in the feuds, and quarrels of the world. This Sirs is not your fight, this is not the <hi>good fight,</hi> this is not <hi>your courſe,</hi> it is not that for which God ſent you into the world for, not the work which he hath given you to do, let others who have begun well in all appearance, be <hi>weary,</hi> &amp; <hi>faint,</hi> &amp; <hi>turn back with the dog to</hi> the <hi>vomit,</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſwine to the</hi> wallowing again in the mire, remember you that God hath promiſed you ſhall reap if you faint not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let me ſpeak firſt to ſuch as are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to God, and hold up this Crown (this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61091:22"/> glorious Crown) to reaſonable Souls, while I ſound a retreat to them from that bad fight wherein they are ingaged, did ever any man fight againſt God and proſper? How happy might you be if you would be perſuaded to underſtand your true enemies, and to ingage againſt the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> if you that are fighting for your luſts, and for the Devil, would turn and fight againſt thoſe luſts which war againſt the Soul; will all the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which you can get over the people and and intereſt of God in the world, or over your Brethren, bring you to this Crown of Righteouſneſs? Will your eager purſuit of the world, and out running of others in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs and concerns (think you) bring you to it? If not, ceaſe that race, and turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right path as of Gods Commandments, run that race the winning of which will bring you to this prize, why ſhould you ſpend your ſtrength for nought, and your time for that which will not profit you in your latter end?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let what you have heard <hi>ingage you who have begun well to go on. If</hi> the <hi>Righteous man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his Righteouſneſs, &amp; Commit iniquity his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall never be remembred, but he ſhall dye in the iniquity which he hath committed.</hi> O let not your hands be weary with holding up the Spiritual weapons, nor your feet be weary of running the ſpiritual race, &amp; do not forget your particular courſe; you can hardly be good Chriſtians if you in ſome tolerable meaſure anſwer not the duties of your particular Relation. God hath ſet all of us in ſome particular Relation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61091:23"/> or other, ſcarce any amongſt us but have more then the charge of our own Souls upon us, ſome of us are ſet in <hi>Conjugal</hi> Relations, ſome in <hi>Parental</hi> Relations, ſome in a <hi>Deſpotick Relation</hi> as Governours of Servants. O let us be all able to ſay, As to theſe <hi>we have finiſhed our courſe,</hi> we have done the work which (as to them) God hath given us to do, we ſhall find it an hard matter cheerfully to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of our departure as at hand, or to love, or cheerfully think upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, till this be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. In the laſt place, This notion affords us a great deal of <hi>Conſolation to thoſe who are mourners for their near and deareſt Relations; and are not mourners without hope;</hi> I muſt confeſs there are ſome mourners, to whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be ſaid to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> them, from the <hi>Revelation of the good, and irreſiſtible will of God,</hi> and ſuch other <hi>Topicks,</hi> but little to <hi>comfort them</hi> concerning thoſe that are gone. But if any have loſt an Husband, a Wife, a Parent, a Child, a Friend of whom they can judge that while they were alive, <hi>They fought the good fight, and finiſhed their courſe, and kept the faith, and loved the appearance of our bleſſed Lord.</hi> We have no reaſon to mourn, there is a <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which the <hi>Righteous Lord</hi> hath in part already ſet upon their heads (their Souls are in <hi>Abrahams Boſom</hi>) and with which he will further incompaſs their heads, dignify both their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> in <hi>that day,</hi> that glorious day, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61091:23"/> of which we live, when he ſhall come to <hi>judge the quick and the dead,</hi> and this leadeth me to a more particular diſcourſe for the end, for which I have this day turned out of the common road of my diſcourſe to take notice of Gods Providence to us in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from us a Servant of his in the great work of the Goſpel: Who hath left a <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> without an Husband, a Child without a Parent, alas! that I cannot alſo ſay a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flock without a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> but the whole flock of Chriſt I can ſay he hath left depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of one labourer more, and that in a time, when the <hi>Harveſt truly is great, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers too too few.</hi> But it is no part of love for our own good to envy the more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, &amp; happineſs of our friends, &amp; our ſorrow for him as a <hi>publick loſs,</hi> is much alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, by that uſeleſs condition (as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice) into which the wiſdom of the Divine Providence had brought him for ſome years, before it pleaſed God to take him to himſelf.</p>
               <p>His converſation from his youth was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to many of you then to my ſelf, he being born, and bred up amongſt you, I ſhall limit my diſcourſe concerning him by my Text, having nothing in further deſign then to ſhew you, that we who believe <hi>that there is a Crown of Righteouſneſs laid up for ſome,</hi> which the Righteous Judge will one day give out to all ſuch as love his appearance, have no reaſon for any diſſatisfaction at this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Providence, becauſe we have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61091:24"/> reaſon to hope that he was one of thoſe <hi>who fought the good fight, who finiſhed his courſe, who kept the faith, who loved the appearance of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>For fighting the good fight:</hi> It reſpecteth the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>Devil;</hi> as to the World, there was none who knew him, who can accuſe him of any purſuit of it, none who ſaw not his neglect of it, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with a competency of it, and could not be tempted to mend his commons in it, by a compliance in any thing which he judged ſinful, he was no man of pleaſure, none of thoſe who ſought great things for himſelf. He did not neglect the work of the Miniſtry while he had a liberty to exerciſe it, and withal to exerciſe (what he judged) a good conſcience, but when he ſaw he could not do that, the profits of ſuch ſervice was no temptation to him, he rather choſe to live upon the little God had given him, and occaſionally to preach the Goſpel where he had an opportunity offered for near twenty years before God took him from us (though indeed for 5 or 6 of thoſe years) he was not fit for any publick ſervice of that nature. <hi>The good fight with the fleſh</hi> is a more ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, of which we can make no judgment, but from a mortified converſation to ſenſible ſatisfactions, as to which I need ſay nothing to you, you know how he walked in, and out before you, dying daily to the contentments of this life, and bringing his body under, and keeping it in ſubjection. But it was his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61091:24"/> managery of this good fight with the <hi>Grand Adverſary</hi> that was to us (to me at leaſt) the moſt perſpicuous, and as to which I was the moſt competent witneſs, in regard of my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converſe with him. It was in the year 1673. (if I remember right) when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to take from him his only Son, a Child in which he much delighted, and whoſe life (probably by giving him ſome diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) kept him from thoſe depths of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> into which he ſoon after fell, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to his dying day, though under ſome different circumſtances. It were infinite to recount all his <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> ſome reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal State:</hi> Some, with reference to the <hi>Actions of his life,</hi> ſo as there was not the moſt lawful action of his life, which he was not at one time, or other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the lawfulneſs of. He had the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Divines, whoſe ſucceſs with him, was but what is uſual in thoſe caſes, they could eaſily ſilence him, and anſwer the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections he made againſt himſelf, and give him a little relief at preſent, but his trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thoughts would return again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new upon him; yet we obſerved God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our indeavours ſo far, as to drive the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> from one <hi>Poſt</hi> to another. But ſtill there came on <hi>new ſupply</hi> from thoſe <hi>Principalities,</hi> with which he was ingaged, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, that his life grew a burden to him, and he ſeemed weary of it, not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to live alwaies, when in living he did not live. His Adverſary brought forth all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61091:25"/> thoſe uſual <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> which he commonly throweth at perſons under his circumſtances. <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Blaſphemous thoughts, Deſpair, Self-Murder;</hi> as to the firſt and ſecond, it ſo far pleaſed God to bleſs our <hi>Brotherly aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to him, advantaged by his own knowledge of the things of God, and acquaintance with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> (which he was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almoſt always to make the ſubject of his Sermons in later years) that he was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months in thoſe combates; but under the latter he laboured ſome years, indeed ſo long, as in the whole courſe of my Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I never knew any who was infeſted with thoſe <hi>Temptations,</hi> but was overthrown by them (if they continued) in much ſhorter times. He hath often affrighted his neareſt Relation, and my ſelf, with telling us. <hi>He muſt put an end to his days, he was not able to bear the</hi> impetus <hi>of the Temptation.</hi> Both my ſelf and others would ſpeak what we judged proper in the cauſe, and for a time were ſucceſsful to divert him, but the <hi>Tempter</hi> came on again, and that with that <hi>violence</hi> as I ſcarce ever knew, I learned in my daily converſe with this good man, the great advantage which <hi>true faith</hi> in any gives a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in ſuch an hour of <hi>temptation:</hi> over what he hath towards one who hath no ſuch root of Grace. In my diſcourſes with him, I u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a much different method from what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have thought proper in the caſe, and in the midſt of theſe <hi>Paroxyſms,</hi> commonly made the <hi>eternal miſery of damned
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61091:25"/> Souls, and the deſperate ſtate of perſons dying in the commiſſion of known ſins the ſubjects of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;</hi> Knowing that if God would bleſs my diſcourſes, to revive <hi>his faith</hi> in ſuch <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Holy Writ,</hi> I ſhould countermine his adverſary, whoſe deſign was to blow up his Soul, by the hopes of a freedom from a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary affliction and miſery. In the mean time, many prayers were put up to God for him, many were made to God with him, and himſelf (if out of his bed) was almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alone upon his knees, ſuch was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that his friends durſt not have truſted him the twentieth part of that time alone, but they knew he was not alone while he was with God, and they found that he was ſafe, becauſe in his company. After the ſpending of ſome years in this degree of deep affliction, it pleaſed God in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to rebuke the <hi>Tempter,</hi> that although his bodily diſtemper yet continued, and by this time it had bred more, yet his mind was much more free from theſe deſperate Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and <hi>impetuous aſſaults,</hi> that if at all any thing of them returned at any time, yet they were not a continual dropping upon his Soul; thus he <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and indeed in this piece of it was more a Conquerour then I ever knew any who was ſo long inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it, and at laſt died the ordinary death of men, quietly in his Bed, ſurrendring his Soul into the hands of him that gave it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the <hi>finiſhing of his courſe;</hi> how he walked in, and out before you, I need not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61091:26"/> tell you, you knew the man, and obſerved his converſation. For the duties of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> while he had a <hi>publick li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> he was no indiligent Preacher; when he was reſtrained as to that, you were alſo ſome witneſſes of his readineſs to that work. For his <hi>Domeſtick Relations,</hi> let his Widow riſe up and call him bleſſed, let his Daughter praiſe him. He ſpent no ſmall proportion of time in opening Scripture, and praying with his Family, and other exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion proper to a Family. He rather erred by exceſs, then by a defect in thoſe exerciſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to his <hi>keeping the faith.</hi> As he was known to all that converſed with him to be ſound in the <hi>Doctrine of faith.</hi> So two <hi>things</hi> ſpake the exerciſe of the habit of that Grace in him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He was much in prayer.</hi> It was almoſt his whole work, for ſome years before he died, he did little elſe but read and pray. When he could no longer <hi>Pray</hi> himſelf, he would continually be ſolliciting others to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, and when he hardly regarded either Wife or Child coming to him, yet he was ſo regardful of this, that he miſſed <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> if at any time any of us had come to him, and gone away, having not prayed with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Much holineſs</hi> ſpeaketh faith. His ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity in his actions, leſt he ſhould by any of them ſin againſt God, was ſuch as indeed was a great part of his Affliction. Indeed the latter part of his life being very <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61091:26"/> and that diſpoſing him to too many fears, and God having for ſome weeks before he died, allowed him but a very incertain uſe of his reaſon, and much deprived him alſo of a liberty of ſpeech, we had not that <hi>lightſome</hi> evidence of his deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which we might have expected from ſuch a converſation. But his quiet bearing Gods ſevere hand upon him, his free ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his will without any murmuring, or repining, added to the former ſpending of his life in a conſtant preparation for death, may ſatisfy us, that he was one <hi>who loved the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> Now I ſay, if we have a ſufficient evidence to hope, that he was indeed one <hi>who fought the good fight,</hi> who had <hi>finiſhed his courſe, who kept the faith, and who loved the appearance of our Lord Jeſus;</hi> what reaſon have we to mourn? Nay, if we conſider what a man of griefs and ſorrows he was in his latter time, what an ill habit of body he had contracted, what a variety of diſeaſes he was incumbred with, and how improbable it was that by the uſe of any art, his body ſhould be recovered to a ſtate of comfort to himſelf, or uſefulneſs to others. We have great cauſe to rejoice in hope. That he is crowned with that <hi>Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which the Righteous God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, laid up, and will give out to thoſe who love his appearance.</p>
               <p>In ordinary caſes where there is no cauſe of ſorrow from a reflection upon the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate of the deceaſed, yet there may be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61091:27"/> ſome cauſe of ſorrow upon the account of the <hi>Churches loſs;</hi> and never was there a greater cauſe of mourning for Godly Miniſters, then at this day. We have cauſe upon all ſuch loſſes, to cry out, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth, and the faithful fail from the children of men:</hi> But in the preſent caſe we have not that cauſe. God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had made him dead to us, before he died, and except in a miraculous way, we could not reaſonably have expected a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (a recovery I mean to any degree of uſefulneſs.)</p>
               <p>So then if there remaineth no cauſe of mourning, either from the conſideration of our friends eternal ſtate, or our own loſs. What remains but that we ſhould lay our hands upon our mouths, or if we will open them, bleſs God who hath granted us to ſee him (after ſo long a ſcuffle with the great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind) <hi>depart in peace;</hi> that he might ſee the Lords Salvation, and be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth the ſtate of thoſe that <hi>ſleep in Jeſus</hi> in another life. I ſhall conclude, as the Apoſtle doth that Chapter, <hi>wherefore comfort yourſelves with theſe words.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>That it is the Lord who giveth unto a people a power to get wealth.</hi> There is nothing in the Doctrine that needeth any explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we all know what is meant by wealth, my whole buſineſs will lie upon the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this truth, that it is the Lord that giveth men power to get wealth, and to ſhew what influence God hath upon men, as to their gaining of outward eſtates, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich,</hi> Eccl. 6.2. <hi>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour</hi> — chap. 9.11. —<hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong;</hi> &amp; 2. By way of Application, to ſhew what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this meditation ſhould have upon us; I ſhall ſpend all my time in anſwering theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What influence hath God upon men as to their gaining or keeping their outward eſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All wealth and outward eſtate, cometh to a man, by <hi>inheritance,</hi> or <hi>marriage,</hi> or by <hi>gift,</hi> or by <hi>labour;</hi> let me ſhew you a little the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence God hath upon all theſe. I will joyn the two firſt together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Lord that maketh <hi>Heirs,</hi> and who maketh <hi>Matches;</hi> we have two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs in this caſe, which are very true, we uſe to ſay, <hi>God maketh Heirs, and Matches are made in heaven,</hi> both are true; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man marrieth the Husband, and the Husband
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61091:28"/> marrieth that Wife which God hath created for him, and that man inheriteth the eſtate which God had created for him.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the influence the Lord hath upon <hi>Heirs,</hi> and this will eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by whoſoever acknowledgeth that the iſſues of life and death are from the Lord, <hi>the fruit of the Womb is from the Lord,</hi> and the iſſues of life and death are in the hand of the Lord; you ſhall find an expreſſion to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, Oh inhabitant of Mareſhah; Mareſha</hi> was a City in <hi>Judah,</hi> it is mentioned alſo, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.44. <hi>Abraham</hi> told God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.3. <hi>One born in his houſe was his heir,</hi> God tells him, <hi>v.</hi> 4. — <hi>This ſhall not be thine heir, one born of thy bowels, ſhall be thy heir,</hi> Pſal. 30.22. <hi>For ſuch as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the earth</hi>— Sometimes a handmaid is heir to her Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, which is one of the three things for which the earth groaned, and which it could not bear (ſaith <hi>Solomon) Prov.</hi> 34.23. One may be heir to his enemy by natural death, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſo happeneth; at what a diſtance doth God ſometimes throw an eſtate, both in a direct line, and in a collateral line? who would have ſaid that <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſhould have been heir to his <hi>Grandfather Saul,</hi> as, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.7. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto him, fear not, for I will ſurely ſhew thee kindneſs, for</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>thy Fathers ſake, and will reſtore thee all the Land of</hi> Saul <hi>thy Father</hi>—or who would have thought the Iſraelites ſhould have been heirs unto the Canaanites? It is the Lord that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61091:29"/> thus giveth a power to get wealth; the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God upon conjugal affection is alſo as ſtrange. I know nothing wherein the ſtrange power and providence of God is more ſeen, then in uniting the affections of that man and woman together, whom he hath ordained each for other, a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall beſtow their Eſtates upon perſons whom they never knew, never heard of; nay. poſſibly upon thoſe againſt whom they were prejudiced; who would have thought <hi>Eſther</hi> (a perſon of mean and obſcure extraction) ſhould have been <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his Queen; or that <hi>Ruth</hi> ſhould have Married <hi>Boaz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the Lord who raiſeth up friends;</hi> this is another fountain head of riches; he it was that gave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> favour in the ſight of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Exod. 11.3. <hi>And the Lord gave the People favour in the ſight of the Aegyptians;</hi> He gave <hi>Joſeph</hi> favour in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh, Acts</hi> 7.10. — <hi>and gave him favour and wiſdom in the ſight of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>King of</hi> Egypt— <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Now God had brought</hi> Daniel <hi>into favour and tender love</hi>— whoſo lightly obſerveth the courſe of the world, will find this verified every day, you may ſee friends raiſed up of ſtrangers, yea, of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even to the amazement of them who behold them, but there is yet another fountain of wealth, and that is <hi>labour and induſtry, Pro.</hi> 10.4— <hi>the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> But you muſt take in another Text. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord, it maketh rich</hi>— and to this purpoſe, let us conſider what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61091:29"/> God hath upon that. In the third place therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is the Lord that enclineth our minds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to buſineſs,</hi> and to that particular employment which bringeth in our eſtate; I ſay it is the Lord that enclineth the mind to buſineſs, and directeth the mind in buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay <hi>he enclineth the mind to buſineſs;</hi> you ſee ſome men are of dull, ſluggiſh and lazy ſpirits, fit for no buſineſs, nor do they mind any, but others are men of activity, they are never well but when their hands are full of employment; who is it that hath made this difference in the ſpirits of men; have they not all Souls of the ſame <hi>ſpecies;</hi> have they not all bodies, though not of the ſame ſtrength, yet of the ſame mould? this is the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It <hi>is the Lord that directeth a mans mind and inclination to this or that particular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: there</hi> are ſome ways of employment in the world, that are of more gain &amp; advantage then others; ſome trades that are poorer, ſome richer; ſome that bring in great, ſome ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler returns; whence cometh it that this man is directed to chooſe a meaner, &amp; poorer trade that bringeth in little return another to a trade that bringeth in greater, is it not from the Lord? That hath this influence upon the heart of man and diſpoſeth, it which way ſoever he will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Lord <hi>that giveth dexterity in buſineſs,</hi> you obſerve in the world, that ſome men are more dexterous and happy in their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61091:30"/> by far then others are, they can do more in their buſineſs, they can do it to better advantages; whence is this? ſee but one inſtance, <hi>Exo.</hi> 31.2. <hi>See, I have called by name</hi> Bezaleel, <hi>the Son of</hi> Uri, <hi>the Son of</hi> Hur, <hi>of the tribe of Judah.</hi> v. 3. <hi>And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wiſdom, and in underſtanding, and in knowledge and in all manner of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> v. 4. <hi>To Deviſe cunning works, to work in Gold, and Silver and in Braſs.</hi> So add v. 6. — <hi>In the hearts of all that are wiſe hearted I have put wiſdom;</hi> again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.35. <hi>Them hath he filled with wiſdom of heart, to work all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work</hi>— Hence you may obſerve in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all employments a fagacity given to one which he cannot communicate to another, ſo that the power and influence of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſeen; you may obſerve that a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to get wealth doth very much depend, not only upon the kind of the employment wherein a man is engaged, but upon the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and cunning of the man, upon his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and ſagacity in his employment; now all this is from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the Lord who giveth ſucceſs in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> there is nothing more ordinary in the world, then to find two men, whoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, trade and way of living poſſibly is the ſame; whoſe induſtry and diligence is as much as can be imagined, equal whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and cunning alſo is not much unlike, yet the one thriveth, and groweth rich, the other doth not, the one vendeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and maketh ſafe and great returns,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61091:30"/> the other cannot vend his commodities, he cannot ſecure his return; whence is this but from the Lord? It is the Lord who maketh our way proſperous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.7. <hi>For the Lord thy God hath bleſſed thee in all the works of thy hand— It is God that bleſſeth in the city, and bleſſeth in the field,</hi> Deut. 28.3. — <hi>Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands,</hi> ſaith the Devil to <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 1.10. Hence the Pſalmiſt teacheth us to pray unto God, to proſper the works of our hands unto us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>It is the Lord who keepeth off thoſe things from us which would make us poor.</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are ſubject to accidents; a mans getting an eſtate dependeth upon anothers keeping his eſtate; the fire may burn, the Thief may break through and ſteal, Ships may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at Sea; infinite many accidents may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and we daily ſee and hear of accidents that happen to the ruine and impoveriſhing of men, and is not thy eſtate as ſubject to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; who is it that keepeth the fire from thee which conſumeth thy Neighbour? and who keepeth the Thief from thee, who plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth thy Neighbour, and leaveth him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? that upholdeth the eſtate of him who dealeth with thee, while he letteth the eſtate of another man who dealeth with another to ſink? who can aſcribe this to any thing but to the influence that God hath upon the world? Now all this juſtifieth this truth, that it is the Lord who giveth power to get wealth; I ſhall add no more in the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Doctrine; I ſhall ſpend the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>Uſe 1. Let me ſpeak unto ſuch to whom the Lord hath not given a power to get wealth; that they would be content to eye the will and good pleaſure of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them; ſome of you are no heirs, you have not been enriched by any matches, you have not been made rich by friends, you have been laborious, but it hath not pleaſed God to bleſs the works of your hands; yet be content.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>It is the diſpenſation of the Lord;</hi> thou doſt not thrive, becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not God to give thee a power to get wealth; we ought in every thing to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the will of God: the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, and God may do with his own what he pleaſeth; if he will give much to one, and little to another, or ſomething to one, and nothing to another, he doth thee no wrong at all; thou haſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no reaſon to murmure, no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine againſt him; eſpecially conſidering what I ſhall further add.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>Wealth is none of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Mercies;</hi> there were two outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which to the Jews were far more juſtifiable cauſes of diſturbance, than they are to Chriſtians, <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Barrenneſs;</hi> the reaſon was, becauſe the promiſes of God to the Jews ran much upon outward things;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61091:31"/> it followeth after the words of the Text, —<hi>For it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may eſtabliſh his covenant, which he ſware unto thy fathers, as at this day.</hi> But the new Covenant reacheth moſt unto Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mercies, <hi>Jer</hi> 32.40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, <hi>Oftentimes a power to get wealth, prejudiceth us in our priviledge to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and our duty to act grace,</hi> James 2.5. <hi>Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom</hi>— Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave it in charge, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>That the rich ſhould not be high-minded, but fear;</hi> Our Saviour doth pronounce a <hi>woe to them that are rich,</hi> Luke 6.24— <hi>For you have received your conſolation;</hi> it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of them that are not rich towards God; but only lay up treaſures for themſelves. So St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1.9. <hi>would have the Brother of low degree rejoice that he is exalted;</hi> he would alſo have the rich rejoice. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>In that he is made low</hi>— but I ſhall inlarge no further upon this branch of application, but come to that which is more proper, and ſpeak a word to thoſe that are rich.</p>
               <p>Exhort. 2. Is it the Lord who giveth you power to get wealth? <hi>Then remember the Lord your God, who hath given you power to get wealth;</hi> It is the Exhortation of the Text,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61091:32"/> upon which I ſhall enlarge a little. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, who giveth thee power to get wealth;</hi> this term <hi>remember,</hi> is a very comprehenſive word; <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them;</hi> it is alſo uſed in many other texts; I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore open this generally, and ſhew you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What duty this calleth to you for, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your getting wealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What duty it calleth to you for, when you have gotten it.</p>
               <p>In reference to the <hi>getting of your wealth,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That you would apply your ſelf to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wealth in the Lords way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Lords way, I mean two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An honeſt courſe of life juſtifiable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A managing this honeſt courſe in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt manner.</p>
               <p>Apply your ſelves and your children to the getting of wealth in an honeſt courſe of life; I ſhall not here undertake to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Trades, which are honeſt, which are diſhoneſt; but there are two ſorts of Trades, or Profeſſions, or ways of life, which I ſhall not commend, nor ſhould chuſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as ſerve meerly to maintain Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition or Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as ſerve meerly for <hi>Idleneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Luxury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as ſerve meerly for Superſtition and Idolatry, like the Silver-Smith, whoſe craft was to make ſhrines for <hi>Diana;</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61091:32"/> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> inveighing againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, maketh all makers of <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Statues,</hi> to be guilty of the ſame ſin with them that worſhip them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another ſort of Trades that ſerve meerly for <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs;</hi> ſuch kind of ways of living as theſe, are by no means to be choſen, becauſe we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Lord ſhould in them, with his bleſſing give us power to get wealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It calleth to you for the managing of your callings in an honeſt manner;</hi> that is, in ſhort, with truth and juſtice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. <hi>The get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of treaſures by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayeth, <hi>that the Lord would remove from him the way of lying</hi>— a lying tongue is one of thoſe things which God hateth; and again, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Lying lips are abomination to the Lord</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It calleth to all you that are employed in getting wealth, to manage all your converſation in ſuch a courſe of religion, as you may expect Gods bleſſing to go along with you,</hi> eſpecially it calleth to you for prayers; it is the bleſſing of the Lord that maketh rich; who can expect the bleſſing of the Lord in the day, that doth not beg it in the morning, and in the evening; he that chooſeth to live as if there were no God in the world, what wonder is it, if God leaveth him to take his courſe, that he ſhall live as if there were no God in the World, if he will not live as to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if there were a God in the world, what wonder is it if the Lord leaveth him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61091:33"/> to live ſo as to his mercy, as if there were no God in the World.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But may ſome ſay, do not we ſee that many grow rich in the world, that yet live without a God in the world, making no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſuch a courſe of Religion as you preſcribe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. I anſwer, it is one thing for God to give a power, another thing for men to have a permiſſion; that Text is worth your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi> There is a great deal of difference in Gods giving outward bleſſings, and much lyeth, whether he giveth them with his bleſſing, or with his curſe; it is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites, That the Lord gave them quails, and while the fleſh was betwixt their teeth, the anger of the Lord ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againſt them.</hi> God gave the <hi>Iſraelites a King in his wrath;</hi> &amp; ſo the Lord ſometimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth riches and honour; <hi>but the bleſſing of the Lord addeth no ſorrow with it,</hi> There was a great difference betwixt the riches of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and the riches of <hi>Gehazi;</hi> no man can expect the bleſſing of the Lord upon his riches and getting wealth, without this courſe of life which I have directed.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What duty doth this call to us for, when we have gotten our wealth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, it calleth to you for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this truth; in ſuch a uſing of your eſtates, as you may thereby teſtifie, that you do not ſay that you by your own hand have gotten this wealth, but the Lord gave you power to get it.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61091:33"/>1. It calleth to you for a cordial acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It calleth to you for a verbal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It calleth to you for a real acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It calleth to you for a cordial acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed your hearts be not lifted up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Then thine heart be lifted up— And thou ſay in thy heart, my power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.</hi> We are ready to be lifted up, for any thing that we have more then others; but conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who hath made thee to differ, and who hath given thee power to get wealth;</hi> what reaſon haſt thou to be proud?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed that in your hearts <hi>you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God the donor and author of it;</hi> do not ſay that by your own power, and by your own wiſdom you have gotten this wealth, the Lord delighteth to do good, but he alſo loveth to be acknowledged and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then is God honoured when you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the mercy which you have to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In your hearts acknowledge Gods mercy, and give him thanks,</hi> keep your Souls in a thankful frame, that when you look upon the houſes which you did not build, and your fields which you did not plant; your Soul may preſently be lifted up to Heaven, and ſay, <hi>God I thank thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.13.</note> 
                  <hi>thou haſt given me land for which I did not labour, and houſes which I did not build.</hi>

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61091:34"/>4. Be thinking in your hearts, what you ſhould do for God; thus was <hi>David, What ſhall I render unto the Lord? I will take the cup of Salvation, and praiſe his holy name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Give the Lord a verbal acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be not aſhamed to own before men that God is gracious;</hi> I have often obſerved, and that not without ſome bluſhing, that even good people, ſuch as fear God, have had a kind of a ſhame upon them to acknowledge their low beginning in the world, and uſed all arts to hide it; we ſhould never be aſhamed to own what God hath done for our Souls, or for our Bodies, that others may be quickned to ſerve God, and to truſt in him; it argueth much of a thankful heart in a Chriſtian, when he is ready upon all occaſions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I was ſuch a poor creature, ſo mean in the world, God hath done thus for me, all theſe are what God hath given me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of being aſhamed to own it before the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. —<hi>With my ſtaff paſſed I over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>and now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come two hands.</hi> You may obſerve in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is one part of our duty in thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, to give God the acknowledgment of what he hath done for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember to give the Lord <hi>a real ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,</hi> that it is he who hath given thee power to get wealth; you will ſay how ſhall that be? I anſwer two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If thou doſt watch thy ſelf, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thy wealth doth not prove the encreaſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61091:34"/> of thy luſt and corruption;</hi> this is too common. Jeſhurun <hi>waxed fat, and kicked up the heel;</hi> I would have you watch your ſelves chiefly as to five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That your Spirits do not heighten with your eſtates;</hi> the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Timothy</hi> to charge <hi>thoſe that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded</hi>— thereby hinting us, that riches have a malign quality to ſwell our minds, and elevate our Spirits, they are things whereby a man in the view of the world, differeth from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſeemeth to excel him, now pride taketh advantage of every ſuch thing, be it never ſo little, to make the Soul to ſwell, and to think of itſelf above what it ought to think; <hi>Solomon</hi> I think ſomewhere telleth us, that the rich man anſwereth roughly, when the poor uſeth intreaties; this we ſee in the experience of every day; now there is nothing more defileth the Soul than <hi>pride;</hi> no Soul is lower in Gods Eyes, then that Soul that is higheſt in its own Eyes; hence you ſhall obſerve; that a wicked man is often in Scripture ſet out under the notion of a proud man, and a godly man under the notion of an humble man; and God is ſaid, <hi>to reſiſt the proud, and to give grace to the humble;</hi> the word tranſlated to reſiſt, ſignifieth to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the order of a battel againſt perſons, and it is obſervable that God is not ſaid any where ſo to reſiſt any but the proud.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Take heed of oppreſſion; —Do not rich men oppreſs you— (ſaith St.</hi> James) <hi>and call
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61091:35"/> you before the Judgment Seats;</hi> This is a ſin proper to the rich, for it ſuppoſeth power, no man can do wrong to another, that hath not a power greater then his, and power muſt be maintained by riches; there are diverſe ſpecies of oppreſſion; there is an oppreſſion in Judgment, this is the ſin of unjuſt Judges; in ſhort, the with-holding of the hire from the labourer, of the wages from the Servant, or any thing from another who hath a right to it, by force &amp; power, is this ſin of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which indeed is the effect both of pride and covetouſneſs, and the proper ſin of thoſe who have much of this worlds goods, &amp; it is one of the crying ſins againſt any Nation, a worm that lieth at the root of great eſtates, in ſo much as the Heathen could ſay,<note place="margin">De male quaeſitis vix gaudet ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius haeres.</note> that an eſtate ill gotten, ſeldom paſſed to the third generation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> Covetouſneſs is an irregular deſire of more than we have, it is ſomething ſtrange, but an old obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the moſt of men, the more they have, the more greedy they are to have more; the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>the love of mony is the root of all evil,</hi> none are under greater temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to love it, then thoſe that have the moſt conſiderable portions of it; there is a kind of bewitching quality in the good things of this life, and our heart naturally cleaveth to them, and in regard that when we have a competent portion, we have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foundation, and are at better advantages to get more, commonly as our eſtates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61091:35"/> ſo our love to things of this life doth more increaſe, and covetouſneſs is ſo great an evil, that the Apoſtle calleth it Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beware of Luxury; Luxury is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in meat, drink, or apparel, buildings, houſhold-ſtuff, or any thing of that nature, an affectation of an undue uſe of them; the poor man hath no temptation to it, being exerciſed ſufficiently in getting his dayly bread, they are only men of eſtates that are expoſed to, and ordinarily brought under the power of this temptation; this is that which the Apoſtle often cautioneth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, that we ſhould beware of Chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Wantonneſs, that we ſhould not mind high things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour preſſing Chriſtians duty to watch and pray, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it by a <hi>taking heed we be not overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Beware of Cowardlineſs in the cauſe of God, it is an uſual Obſervation, that Cities, though never ſo populous, yet if full of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſeldom make any good defence againſt an enemy, their love of riches prevailing againſt the love of their liberties, and they are very rarely men of great eſtates, that will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themſelves in the cauſe of God, though this be to prefer the love of riches before the love of Chriſt, which whoſo doth, our Saviour ſaith, is not worthy of him, theſe are thoſe ordinary temptations to ſin, to which men of great eſtates are expoſed, and by which many often fall; I ſhall only ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61091:36"/>2. If you look upon your ſelves as Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of theſe good things, and make uſe of them to the end for which God hath given them to you; God hath betruſted him that is rich with many talents, not to be hid up in a Napkin, but to be laid out, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in incertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate.</hi> This is the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that we can make unto God, that by his power we have gotten our wealth, when we are willing to lay it out at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when we are ready to do good, and diſtribute; for with ſuch ſacrifice the Lord is well pleaſed; and certainly if the Heathen, who knew nothing of the mind and will of God, yet thought themſelves concerned to look upon their eſtates as given them for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes then meerly their own; Chriſtians that have ſo many directions from God in the caſe, ſhould know much more.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The continuance and preſervation of a mans life, doth not lie in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth;</hi> In this ſenſe life is taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5. —<hi>For God did ſend me before you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life,</hi> Gen. 42.2. —<hi>and buy for us from thence, that we may live, and not die.</hi> And ſo often in Scripture, life ſignifieth the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and continuance of life; the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the life of man doth not lie in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth; abundance is not neceſſary to preſerve life; the greateſt abundance that we have, will not lengthen out our lives beyond the bounds God hath ſet; <hi>Natura paucis contenta;</hi> we ſee the lives of thoſe preſerved, to whom God hath not

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Life, ſometimes ſignifieth happineſs;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt of men count their great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to lie in this life; therefore you ſhall find frequently in Scripture, life is taken for a ſtate of felicity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the iſſues of life,</hi> Prov. 6.23. <hi>Reproofs and inſtruction are the way of life,</hi> Prov. 16.15. <hi>In the light of the Kings countenance is life</hi>— that Text is to be underſtood of happineſs, for to underſtand it ſtrictly of life, it is not true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Death and life are in the power of the tongue</hi>— Ezek. 33.15. <hi>That walk in the Statutes of life</hi>— Thus in Scripture ſenſe a man is ſaid to live, with whom it is well; I take much of the ſenſe to lie here; <hi>for a mans life lieth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> The happineſs of a man doth not lie in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that he poſſeſſeth; <hi>In the abundance,</hi> it cannot be denied but ſomething of a mans happineſs as to this lies in ſome poſſeſſion, by what we have, we are kept from thoſe anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61091:38"/> from thoſe labours which would make our lives uncomfortable, but it doth not lie in the abundance of that which he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; thus you ſee I have diſpatched the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An abundance of this life is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the maintenance of it; it hath been proved to you by a double proof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shewing you, that thoſe who have but little, yet may injoy much in this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe who have much, are often ſhorter lived, and more incumbred then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have but little.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the felicity of a mans life; the chief felicity of this life doth not lie in the abundance that he poſſeſſeth; this is that which I ſhall endeavour as briefly as I can to demonſtrate unto you; the demonſtration of it will appear upon a due conſideration, wherein the happineſs of a man lieth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the happineſs of a mans life lieth.</p>
               <p>Reaſon ſheweth that happineſs muſt needs lie in the greateſt immunity from evil, and in the freeſt enjoyment of the beſt good, whether we take happineſs relating to this life, or to that which is to come, the nature of happineſs lieth in a fruition of good, and a freedom from evil, and according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the good we enjoy, or of the evil we are freed from, ſo is our happineſs; now good and evil is judged according to the differing lives that men live; there is a natural life, and there is a ſpiritual life; the greateſt good of a natural life is comfort and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, a contented frame of ſpirit;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61091:38"/> the greateſt good of a ſpiritual life is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God; ſo that take it in which ſenſe you will, it will eaſily be demonſtrated to you, that a mans life, the comfort and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of it, doth not lie in the abundance he poſſeſſeth; I remember a ſtory I have read of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a great Prin. who going to <hi>Italy</hi> to fight againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rainoldi Orat.</hi> p. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Cneus Theſſalus</hi> had a mind to diſſuade him, he telleth him; my Lord! the <hi>Romans</hi> are Valiant and Warlike; but if we ſhould overcome, what ſhall we do then? what ſhall we do, ſaith <hi>Pyrrhus?</hi> then we will conquer all <hi>Greece,</hi> and all other Nations will yield to us; well, ſaith <hi>Cneus,</hi> and what then? then, (ſaith <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>) we will go and conquer <hi>Sicily,</hi> a rich Country; that is well, ſaith he, but what ſhall we do then? then (ſaith he) we will fall upon <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Carthage;</hi> ſaith he, but what ſhall we do then? <hi>Hilaritati nos trademus, &amp; facetis, colloquiis nos oblectabimur</hi> (ſaith he;) <hi>Cneus</hi> replieth, but may we not let all theſe things alone, which will coſt much blood, and be happy without them?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The abundance that a man poſſeſſeth, <hi>will not give him any quiet and ſatisfaction in his mind,</hi> Prov. 14.14. —<hi>a good man ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from himſelf.</hi> The ſatisfaction of a mans mind is from nothing without himſelf, it is in the internal content and acquieſcence of his mind; this is a matter of every days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, it is plain that no man is happy that wanteth content and ſatisfaction. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is a man advanced to great honour, yet he is not ſatisfied, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſitteth in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61091:39"/> the Kings Gate; ſo long as the deſires of a man are not filled, ſo long a man is not happy; now a man may have abundance, and yet be ambitious, and yet be covetous, and looking after, and getting more, and crying ſtill, <hi>give, give,</hi> hence it is, that even in this world you ſhall ſee a poor man that hath little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live upon, yet live a more ſweet, a more comfortable life, then he who hath a great eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A man may poſſeſs abundance as to the things of this life, and yet enjoy nothing of God;</hi> the happineſs of a natural life, lieth in the ſatisfaction of the mind, in a moderate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the things of this life, but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a ſpiritual life lieth not here; it is poſſible that a man may be filled with wind, &amp; ſatisfied with that which ought not to give him any ſatisfaction, though the appearing happineſs of a man lieth in this, and his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happineſs be in the reſt and acquieſcing of his mind in what he hath; yet the true happineſs of the mind lieth higher, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that good which commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and adequate to the neceſſities of the Soul, now nothing of good is commenſurate to the neceſſity of the Soul, but God alone, the reaſon of this lieth, becauſe a man is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated under an Ordination to an eternal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in a life which is beyond this life; and a man cannot be ſaid to be truly and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, till he be either ſecured in his hope, or in his poſſeſſion of this; the poſſeſſion of this is referred to another life, but the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61091:39"/> of this, is in this life, by a lively hope, and by an aſſurance; now every one ſeeth that the happineſs of a mans life as to this cannot lie in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth; a man may poſſeſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance here, and yet come ſhort of Heaven, yea, ſaith the Scripture; <hi>Not many rich, not many noble.</hi> There are not many to whom the Lord giveth a portion here and hereafter too. <hi>Son</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives) remember thou hadſt thy good things in thy life-time,</hi> ſome indeed in this world are the Lords <hi>Benjamins,</hi> he ſerveth them with a double meſs; they have much of the Creature, and much of the Creator too, but I ſay this is the portion of but very few; but this is enough to have ſpoken as to the opening of the point, and proving it, ſhewing you that the happineſs of a mans life, doth not lie in the abundance which he poſſeſſeth; I come now to apply it; and the great uſe of this point, ſhall be that which our Saviour maketh of it.</p>
               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>Take heed-therefore, and beware of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs;</hi> It is an exhortation that is much preſſed upon Chriſtians in Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. Let your converſation be without cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. —<hi>let it not be once named amongſt you</hi>— Col. 3.5. —<hi>and covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry,</hi> Pſal. 10.3. —<hi>the covetous whom the Lord abhorreth.</hi> You ſhall find it joined with the vileſt ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Being filled with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whiſperens,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61091:40"/> Prov. 28.16. —<hi>he that hateth covetouſneſs, ſhall prolong his days.</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. <hi>For this you know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous man, who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> So alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> In the further proſecution of this uſe, I ſhall do 2 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will open to you the <hi>true notion of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I will ſhew you by <hi>what Arguments you ſhall arm</hi> your ſelves <hi>againſt it,</hi> &amp; in particular ſhew you the force of this argument.</p>
               <p>There are two words in the Greek, which comprehend much of the nature of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a love of mony, a love of ſilver, and a deſire ſtill of having and getting in the world; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs may be ſhortly deſcribed thus: It is <hi>an immoderate deſire of riches,</hi> and the enjoying the things in this life; a deſire of riches duly moderated and regulated, is not ſinful, riches are <hi>ſubſidia vitae,</hi> they are the aids of this life, as God hath allotted us a time to live in this world, and hath ſubjected our life to many neceſſities, and hath created the inferiour Creatures for the uſe and ſervice of man, to ſupply his neceſſities, ſo for a man under due circumſtances to deſire a ſhare in them, is not ſinful, and cannot come under the name of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> but when this deſire exceedeth its due bounds, then it becometh ſinful and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61091:40"/> degenerateth into this vice of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> in ſhort, this corrupt habit of Covetouſneſs doth diſcover itſelf in our hearts, by five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It diſcovereth itſelf by <hi>immoderate cares,</hi> thinking and contriving how a man ſhould get the things of this life; there is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous care, and there is a pious care, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> There is a great difference betwixt carefulneſs and immoderate care; we are bid in Scripture to caſt all our care upon God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> God alloweth us a provident care, but he forbiddeth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting, dividing care, a Chriſtian hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to take care for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32. <hi>But I would have you without carefulneſs</hi>— immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate care argueth an immoderate deſire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Covetouſneſs diſcovereth itſelf by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate labour,</hi> we ought to labour; <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy bread,</hi> it is a reproach to eat the bread of idleneſs; and it is the Apoſtles precept, that he who will not labour, ſhould not eat; yet we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to labour; <hi>John</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life</hi>— So that it is only an exceſſive, undue labour which God forbiddeth; but now you will ſay, what is that you call immoderate care, and immoderate labour? I anſwer in ſhort, both care and labour are immoderate when they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61091:41"/> turn to the prejudice of the body, or to the prejudice of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When they turn to the prejudice of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> there is nothing ſo eateth a man up, as care and ſolicitude, they do as it were divide the man; and what influence labour hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body, the ſame influence care hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind; care is then immoderate, and ſo is labour, when it turneth to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Soul or Body; for in reaſon the Soul is better then the Body, and the life is better then rayment; God hath commanded us in the firſt place to look after our Souls, and we are bound to care for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When they turn to the prejudice of the Soul,</hi> by hindering its communion with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either in the more inward exerciſes of <hi>meditation, faith,</hi> and <hi>truſting in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Or more outward exerciſes, ſuch as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and thoſe religious duties which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us; that a man cannot find time to pray or hear the Word of God, or to perform any religious duty which the Lord requireth of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Covetouſneſs diſcovereth itſelf by uſing of undue means; when men will get riches by lying, by cheating, by defrauding, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, this is a great argument to a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous mind; for the deſire muſt be immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which prompteth a man to ſuch irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and immoderate actions as theſe are.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By an immoderate fear, when we have them, of loſing them; the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome who through fear of death, <hi>were all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61091:41"/> their lives ſubject to bondage,</hi> truly there are in the world men ſo covetous, as through fear of poverty, and through fear of want are all their life-time ſubject to bondage, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying any thing of what they have.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth thing, which diſcovereth a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous mind, is <hi>a diſſatisfaction in the midſt of our enjoyments,</hi> when the mind is not filled, God hath given one man more then he hath given perhaps to ſome Families, yet his mind is not filled, he doth not ſay that he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A ſixth and laſt thing which diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a covetous mind, is, <hi>an immoderate love and delight in what we have; Soul, take thine eaſe,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt goods laid up for thee for many years.</hi> Now this immoderate joy and delight appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>exceſs of a mans delight;</hi> when a mans heart is even melted into his bags, and runs out into his gold and ſilver.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When a man can by no means indure to part with his riches; either when nature calleth for them; or when God calleth for them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When nature calleth for our riches;</hi> for our ſelves for food and rayment; for our Children to diſpoſe them in the world; but this almoſt every one will acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When God calleth for our eſtate,</hi> God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for it when your Brethren are in want, poor, and in priſon; when you cannot part with it, when nature calleth for it, or when God by his Word calleth for it, it argueth a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61091:42"/> too great love &amp; delight in it; &amp; conſequently a too great deſire of it; I beſeech you take heed and beware of this <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> there are many Arguments, by which the Scripture preſſeth this upon you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſinfulneſs of it,</hi> Iſa. 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetouſneſs I was wroth</hi>—</p>
               <p n="2">2. The exceeding ſinfulneſs of it; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it Idolatry. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs, which is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith it is not to be named, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.3. <hi>But fornication, and all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or covetouſneſs, let it not once be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you</hi>— It is joined with the worſt of ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. Such as thoſe who are guilty of them, ſhall never enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. <hi>Being filled with all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs</hi>—&amp;c. Thirdly, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="3">3. What a root of evil it is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>For the love of mony is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves thorow with many ſorrows.</hi> All neglect of duty lying, cheating, defrauding, oppreſſing; it is endleſs to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon how many evils grow from this one root of covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, Fourthly, The unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; no man by thinking can add one cubit to his ſtature; how many do we ſee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves with care, fear, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and labour, and when they have done all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61091:42"/> they can, they are not able to reach to their ends. I only deſire further to preſs upon you this one argument of our Saviour, which you have in the Text; <hi>A mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, An abundance is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this life; <hi>ad manum eſt quod ſat eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, Sudamus ad ſupervacanea,</hi> a moderate care, a moderate labour is enough for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what we ſweat for is uſually ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, an abundance is not neceſſary for thy own life, nor for the life of thy Child; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is neceſſary, but an abundance is not neceſſary; God hath ſo graciouſly ordained, that our life lieth not in the abundance of what we have, life is not maintained by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of what we have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, An abundance will not leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then out thy life; you ſee Princes, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and rich men, they die as well as others, ſomething of this world, is ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep a man living, but an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance will not lengthen out a mans life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, The happineſs of thy life doth not lie in the abundance of what thou haſt in poſſeſſion; doth not thy happineſs lie rather in the reſt, and quiet content and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thy mind; when thou haſt gotten all thy heart can wiſh, all that thy Childs heart can wiſh, haſt thou in the leaſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed content to thy ſelf, or to him? If God arms but one thought againſt thee, or thy Child? it ſpoileth all thy ſatisfaction; if but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61091:43"/> an humour be diſordered in thy body, and thy ſelf or thy Child be in a melancholy temper, all the world will not give thy mind reſt; why then doſt thou labour? why doſt thou cark and care, and art ſo ſolicitous? thy life lieth not in the abundance of the things thou poſſeſſeſt; but thus much is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the firſt Exhortation; take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs; and conſider whatſoever hath been ſaid as to your ſelves, is true as to your Children, ſo as you need not make that a pretence for your immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſires.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. My ſecond uſe is that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1.8. <hi>And having food and rayment, let us be therewith content.</hi> Food and Rayment are neceſſaries; if the Lord giveth us but enough to cloath us, and to feed us, let us never be concerned; mark how many arguments might be brought for this from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We brought nothing into the world, we can carry nothing out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation, and hurtful luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The love of mony is the root of all evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain;</hi> if God hath given us but enough, let us be therewith content. <hi>Agur</hi> begged no more then <hi>food convenient for him;</hi> he prayed againſt <hi>riches,</hi> as well as againſt <hi>poverty, Gen.</hi> 28.20. See <hi>Jacobs</hi> vow. <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>vowed a vow, ſaying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61091:43"/> eat, and rayment to put on,</hi> &amp;c. It is a ſhame for Chriſtians, they ſhould not conſider how contented the Heathens were, and with what ſcorn they would look upon all the world. What! have Chriſtians principles below thoſe of Heathens? there were two opinions of Philoſophers, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought riches was no ingredient to mans happineſs; others ſaw a neceſſity of ſome of this worlds gooods for the exerciſe of Virtue, but all agree in this, that the happineſs of a man doth not lie in the abundance of the things which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3. What an opportunity doth this offer to thoſe that are poor to bleſs God? The Apoſtle rejoiced that God had opened a door of ſalvation for the Gentiles; let thoſe that are poor in this world rejoice, and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice for them for this door of happineſs, which is opened for them by theſe words of our Saviour; if only the rich could be happy, if content were entailed upon them only, then none could be happy but the rich, but bleſſed be God it is not ſo; the poor man may be happy as well as the rich, ſpiritually happy as well as the rich man.</p>
               <p>Uſe 4. In the next place; ſee here what an encouragement here is to do good, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour viewing thoſe who were throwing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the treaſury, ſaw ſome throw in a great deal, and a poor Widow throwing in two Mites, our Saviour ſaid, ſhe had done more then they all; for they had thrown in out of their abundance, but ſhe out of her penury
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61091:44"/> and want; <hi>a mans life doth not lie in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of what he poſſeſſeth;</hi> God doth not call to you to throw away that wherein your life lieth, nor thoſe things which are neceſſary for your life; he only calleth to you to throw in out of your abundance; he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to you only for your ſuperfluities; and certainly it is but reaſonable that we ſhould part with theſe, when God calleth for them; eſpecially if we conſider that God hath but made us his Stewards of theſe, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given us them: that we ſhould at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand part with them.</p>

               <p>The ſubſtance of the Epiſtle is <hi>hortatory, conſolatory,</hi> and <hi>minatory;</hi> he exhorteth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> v. 6. <hi>To ſtir up the gift of God that was in him</hi>— and this he preſſeth by ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. v. 6.7. <hi>For God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a ſound mind;</hi> in the verſe where the text is, he exhorteth him, <hi>not to be aſhamed of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               <p>This verſe is made up of an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and the <hi>Argument,</hi> the <hi>Exhortation</hi> is in three branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to be aſhamed of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>who was at this time a priſoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>To partake of the afflictions of the Goſpel;</hi> the Propoſitions of the text are theſe.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>That Miniſters and Chriſtians have a teſtimony to give unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the giving of which, they are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a Priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That it is the duty of faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People not to be aſhamed to give this teſtimony,</hi> nor of others when they do give it.</p>
               <p>Prop. 3. <hi>There are Afflictions that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 4. <hi>That both Miniſters and People ought to be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 5. <hi>It muſt be through the power of God, that any one is inabled to partake of the afflictions of the Goſpel.</hi> According to the power of God. It is the third of theſe only that I intend to make the ſubject of my diſcourſe, the others will fall in in the handling of that.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>That it is the duty both of Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Chriſtians owning the Goſpel, not to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61091:46"/> be aſhamed of the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, nor of the afflictions of the Goſpel, but to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the handling of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> there are theſe Queſtions, which I ſhall ſpeak unto in their order.</p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What is meant by the teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What afflictions are they, which are ſaid to be the afflictions of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu, 3. <hi>When may men be ſaid to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord, and how far are we bound not to be ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 4. <hi>Why are we bound not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of Chriſt, and why ought we not to be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What is meant by the teſtimony of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Teſtimony is an <hi>atteſtation which any one giveth concerning any perſon, or concerning any thing;</hi> In every teſtimony there is to be conſidered three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſon,</hi> who giveth the Teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Thing,</hi> to which the Teſtimony is given.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Way,</hi> by which the Teſtimony is given. As to the preſent <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of which we are ſpeaking, the Perſons that give it, are the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſuch a one was <hi>Timothy,</hi> but they are not all ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, —<hi>I ſaw under the Altar, the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held;</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61091:47"/> Miniſter is a ſpecial witneſs, and to bear his Teſtimony, and every good Chriſtian is alſo to be a witneſs. It is ſaid of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. —<hi>who before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion;</hi> every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought in this to be conformable unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing which is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Teſtimony, is the thing or perſon to which it relateth, for the term Teſtimony is a <hi>Relative</hi> word, and the proper <hi>Correlate</hi> to it is <hi>Truth,</hi> which relates again either to a <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> or to a <hi>matter of fact;</hi> no perſon can be under any obligation to give Teſtimony to a lie, but now truth relateth either to a <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> or to a <hi>fact;</hi> every man is a debtor to the truth, and is bound as a man to bear Teſtimony. Chriſt telleth <hi>Pilate,</hi> John 18.37. —<hi>to this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth</hi>— but when I ſpeak of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that every good Chriſtian is bound to give, I underſtand it not thus largely; for though it be that every good man is under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to teſtifie the truth in any cauſe, yet the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and every good Chriſtian is under a more ſpecial obligation to give teſtimony to <hi>ſome truths,</hi> and theſe are the truths of the Goſpel, the truths that relate to Jeſus Chriſt; this is that the text calleth, the <hi>Teſtimony of our Lord,</hi> which may be taken in a double ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61091:47"/>1. Either for <hi>that Teſtimony which our Lord bare of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Or the <hi>Teſtimony which every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is bound to give to the truths of the Goſpel.</hi> Chriſt bare a Teſtimony of himſelf; he teſtified that he was the ſon of God, that he was the King of <hi>Zion,</hi> that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> but I underſtand it yet larger; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſter of the Goſpel, and every good Chriſtian is obliged to bear a Teſtimony to the great truths of the Goſpel, which relate to Jeſus Chriſt, as our Lord and Saviour; there is a Teſtimony which he ought to bear to thoſe Propoſitions of truth, and to thoſe matters of fact, which the Goſpel containeth and relateth concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as the Saviour of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing which is conſiderable in a Teſtimony, is the way of giving it; the proper giving a Teſtimony, is by the words of our mouth; either with an oath, or without an oath; it is one thing for a man to believe a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and another thing for him to give <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to a <hi>Propoſition;</hi> he believeth a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> that hearing it, doth in heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agree to it, that the Predicate is well fitted to the Subject, whether he ſpeaketh a word, yea, or no; but he teſtifieth, that with his words owneth and declareth his faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>For with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> It is not enough for a Chriſtian ſecretly in his heart to agree to the truths of the Goſpel, but he is bound to give
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61091:48"/> a Teſtimony; <hi>If thou ſhalt therefore confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, there are two things made neceſſary to to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A heart believing the Propoſition of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>An external confeſſion or profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a double confeſſion, a Chriſtians duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A confeſſion of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A confeſſion of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either confeſſion is an open acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our lips, thus you read in Scripture frequently of confeſſing of Chriſt, only it may be there is this difference betwixt a Teſtimony and confeſſion; any open, aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vindicating, and defending Chriſt and his Goſpel, is <hi>giving a Teſtimony,</hi> but when it is done in the face of Enemies, in deſpight of oppoſition, this is confeſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Luke 12.8. —<hi>whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs me before men</hi>— thus, <hi>John</hi> 12.42. <hi>Many believed on him; but becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not confeſs him.</hi> So that the teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſignifieth, that open acknowledgment of Chriſt, and profeſſion of the truths of the Goſpel, relating to Chriſt, which is the duty of every good Chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61091:48"/>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What is here meant by the afflictions of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Original</hi> doth ſomething differ, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſuffer thou evils toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Goſpel; where the Goſpel is brought in as if it were a Perſon by a figure; a Perſon that is ſubject to evils. <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted to ſuffer evil with the Goſpel; this leads me to the conſideration what thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are, what thoſe evils are to which the Goſpel is ſubjected; there are ſeveral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to which the Goſpel is ſubjected, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils from three ſorts of perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the true Profeſſors of it; ſuch as own Chriſt in truth and ſincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the falſe and ſeeming Profeſſors of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the profeſſed enemies of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The afflictions of the Goſpel are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which men are ſubjected to, from their owning and profeſſing of the Goſpel, and theſe I ſay are from 3 ſorts of Perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From ſuch as are the true and ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it,</hi> they may bite and devour one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and be thorns and goads in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſides. Theſe commonly are ſo from one of theſe two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From an overheated zeal for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of different apprehenſions in ſome matters of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From ſuch corruptions as do attend Gods people,</hi> conſidered as men, made up of fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From an immoderate zeal for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61091:49"/> of different apprehenſions in ſome matters of truth;</hi> truth is an uniform thing, and is but one; two contradictory Propoſitions cannot be true; but ſince the fall of man none have the ſame apprehenſions, there are different apprehenſions concerning truth; it is true, we have the promiſe of the Spirit of truth to <hi>guide us, and to lead us into all truth;</hi> but the ſenſe of the promiſe muſt not be extended ſo far, that becauſe all Chriſtians have the ſpirit of God, therefore they ſhall all be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they ſhall not have miſapprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Propoſition of truth, they ſhall be guided into all neceſſary truth, they ſhall not miſcarry in any apprehenſion of truth, upon which the ſalvation of their Souls depend; but they may be miſtaken as to a multitude of particular <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> one may judge one thing, and another another thing, yet they all hold the foundation the fundamental truths of the Goſpel; but they may have very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſions as to ſome particular truths: now through an over-weaning opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own apprehenſions, there are very great differences, and alſo hard cenſurings and condemnings of one another, and theſe are great afflictions, but ſuch as have attended the Goſpel from the very beginning; they were ſuch different apprehenſions that cauſed the firſt Chriſtian Synod. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, <hi>Some came and taught the neceſſity of circumciſion</hi>— ſuch differences there were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2. <hi>For one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth herbs;</hi> hence they judged, deſpiſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61091:49"/> and cenſured one another, and the Apoſtle perſuadeth to a friendly carriage one towards another, a mutual forbearance one of another, in theſe different apprehenſions in matters of truth of a lighter nature; mens immoderate zeal for their own opinions, have in all times begot great heats, and have cauſed great afflictions to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and to the Profeſſors of it, and have been a great root of bitterneſs amongſt Gods own people, we have ſeen enough of it in the age, and in this part of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord hath caſt our lot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another root of this bitterneſs hath been, <hi>Thoſe paſſions that the beſt of men have been ſubject to. Elijah</hi> was a great man of God, yet, <hi>Jam</hi> 5.17. <hi>Elias was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are</hi>— and the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> telleth them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. —<hi>Whereas there is among you envying and ſtrife, and diviſions, are you not carnal?</hi> the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. —<hi>that the Spirit that is in us luſteth to envy.</hi> Envy is a peeviſh paſſion, it maketh us to repine at the good of another, and though it ought to be rooted out of the heart of Gods people, and is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet ſomething of it remaineth, and it is very often ſeen, that when ſome Miniſters of the Goſpel excel others in Parts, or in Grace, or private Chriſtians ſo exceed; through this luſt of envy which is in the hearts of others, they are expoſed to cenſures, and to be evil ſpoken of, others grudging at them; which are all fruits of the old man which are in us,

                  <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi> Acts 15.39. <hi>And the contention was ſo ſharp betwixt them, that they departed aſunder, one from the other,</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> was ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, that it was onely whether they ſhould carry <hi>John</hi> with them, yea, or no, but it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo hot, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> upon it left one another, <hi>Paul</hi> went one way, and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> went another way, theſe are ſome of the afflictions of the Goſpel, not cauſed by the Goſpel, but incident to them who promote the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But a ſecond ſort of men that raiſe up afflictions to the Miniſters and Profeſſors of the Goſpel, are <hi>falſe Brethren;</hi> men who have received the truth, but not in the love of it, who from ſome luſts would pervert the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, and become great enemies to the ſincere Profeſſors of it, and that chiefly two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By broaching and publiſhing ſome Doctrines that are contrary to the truths of the Goſpel,</hi> the Apoſtle experienced ſome of theſe in the firſt beginning of the Goſpel; no ſooner was the Goſpel preached in <hi>Galatia,</hi> but there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſome <hi>that troubled</hi> them, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Doctrine of Chriſt; upon this account it is, that the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> calleth the <hi>Jews</hi> thoſe of the <hi>conciſion,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you of many Antichriſts that aroſe in his time, ſo as you read ſomething of this in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Epiſtle of the Apoſtles, theſe things have conſtantly given a great deal of trouble to the faithful Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61091:50"/> and alſo them who have been the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By aſperſing the faithful Miniſters and Profeſſors of the Goſpel,</hi> to leſſen their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and make them odious unto people, ſometimes affixing crimes to them that they never deſigned in their hearts, ſometimes by aſperſing them as weak &amp; unlearned men; you ſhall ſee this was a great art they uſed againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as you will obſerve by reading over the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and his Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> this maketh him ſpeak ſo much in his own defence, and in the commendation and magnifying of his Office, nay, they ſpeak of him as if he were a reprobate, they ſought a proof of Chriſt in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. which cauſed him to ſay, <hi>Since you ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak</hi>— &amp; v. 4. —<hi>for we alſo are weak in him, but we ſhall live with him by the power of God;</hi> he ſaith, v. 6. <hi>But I truſt you ſhall know we are not reprobates.</hi> v. 7. — <hi>I pray to God that you do no evil— but that you ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be as reprobates.</hi> Theſe are a ſort and kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which the Goſpel of Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways met with in the true Profeſſors of it; now the root of this is nothing but wrath, and malice, and envy, luſt liveth and reigneth in the hearts of ſuch, who though they have made a profeſſion of the truth, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received it in the love of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The afflictions of the Goſpel are <hi>thoſe afflictions which are brought upon the faithful
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61091:51"/> Miniſters and Profeſſors of the Goſpel for their Profeſſion, from the open and profeſſed enemies of it;</hi> now theſe are to be conſidered in their kinds, and in their cauſes; <hi>In their kinds;</hi> In ſhort, they are all ſorts of external afflictions, man can kill the body, and hurt the outward man, but he can do no more; but ſo far as they can, they will go; reproaches and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies reſpecting men in their honour and reputation, rifling their eſtates, caſting them into Priſons, taking away their lives; in ſhort, whatſoever can be afflictive to the outward man, for there are no ſort of external afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but we ſhall find that the true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Profeſſors of the Goſpel have met with, <hi>James</hi> was killed with the Sword, <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to death; the Apoſtles were often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, others, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of cruel mockings, and ſcourgings, yea, of bonds and impriſonments, they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were tempted, they were ſlain with the Sword, they wandered about in Sheep-skins, and in Goat-skins, being tormented, of whom the world was not worthy;</hi> the ſtory of Scripture, and the ſtory of the ſeveral Martyrs doth ſufficiently tell us what the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Goſpel are, but why the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould ſuffer ſuch things, or men ſhould ſuffer ſuch things for the publiſhing, owning, and profeſſing the Goſpel, may ſeem a little wonderful, and deſerveth a further enquiry; for if we conſider the nature of the Goſpel, the very import of the word is no other then a good meſſage, or good tidings; the Angel
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61091:51"/> gave the Goſpel its true name; when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. —<hi>behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people.</hi> So as there is nothing in the whole ſyſteme of the Goſpel, that can deſerve any hatred of it, the Goſpel is nothing elſe but that good ſaying, that, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come into the world to ſave Sinners; —That God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth on him ſhould have everlaſting life;</hi> what hath Chriſt done? or what is there in the Goſpel that ſhould provoke the luſts and paſſions of men to give any oppoſition, that there ſhould be any affliction entailed to the Goſpel?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, the true root of this lieth in that <hi>enmity which God hath ſet betwixt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her ſeed, and the Serpent and his ſeed,</hi> you have it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt thee and the Woman, and betwixt thy ſeed and her ſeed</hi>— the Womans ſeed was Chriſt, the Serpents ſeed are vile, wicked, and ungodly men, there is an enmity, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enmity betwixt theſe two, and ſo long as the world endureth, this enmity will abide, and the Devil will be managing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to drive Chriſt, and the Goſpel of Chriſt out of the world; all the reproaches of Miniſters and Godly Chriſtians, all their bonds and impriſonments which they ſuffer for the Goſpel, they are but the fruits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this enmity, this hatred and antipathy which is betwixt Chriſt and the Devil, and the ſeed of Chriſt, and the ſeed of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61091:52"/>2. Another reaſon of it lieth in the nature of the <hi>Propoſitions of the Goſpel, as to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of faith, and as to the precepts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo far as it concerneth holineſs,</hi> the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the firſt, and the purity of the latter, and its exceeding ſtrictneſs. The ſublimeneſs of the Doctrine of faith, raiſeth it two ſorts of enemies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ignorant perſons of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe men who have idolized their own reaſon,</hi> and are determined to believe nothing but what they can fathom by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, ignorant Perſons; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth us of ſome who <hi>ſpeak evil of what they know not,</hi> there is nothing more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a man then this, yet there is nothing more ordinary, eſpecially when men appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ways and perſons that they ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of, are enemies to their luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8. —<hi>we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the hidden wiſdom which God ordained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world unto our glory. Which none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The wiſdom of God ſignifieth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Princes of this world did not know it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> The moſt ignorant perſons, if they be alſo looſe in their lives, are enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Men that have idolized their own reaſon,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61091:52"/> and entertained a fancy that they ſhould compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the higheſt myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi> that which maketh them enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt, is their zeal; they are puff'd up in their own opinion of their own reaſon, and are certain enemies to whatever they cannot comprehend with it; now the Doctrines of the Goſpel being of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſublime nature, that ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot comprehend them, and men of reaſon cannot fathom them with their own reaſon, they become enemies unto them, and to the true Profeſſors of them; hence it was that the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of old were ſuch enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the ſublimity of the Propoſitions of the Goſpel is one great reaſon of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it meeteth with in the world; ſo the <hi>exceeding purity and holineſs of the precepts of the Goſpel</hi> is another reaſon; take the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as it bringeth news of a Saviour who died for ſinners, it pleaſeth them well enough; but look upon it as it containeth a ſyſteme of precepts, an obedience to which, muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in order to the obtaining of that ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo it quite croſſeth the grain of fleſh and blood, as it teacheth us that <hi>no Drunkard, no Fornicator, no Swearer ſhall come into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> thus they cannot approve of it; and this maketh them enemies, as to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Goſpel, ſo to the Miniſters and Profeſſors of it; for though they have ſo much luſt as will not ſuffer them to comply with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, yet they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61091:53"/> have alſo ſo much pride, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure themſelves to be contradicted, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Profeſſors of it; but this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſhew you what the afflictions of the Goſpel are, of which the Apoſtle would have <hi>Timothy</hi> content to be a partaker; and what that teſtimony of Chriſt is, of which he would not have him to be aſhamed; I come now to the next Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Qu. 3. <hi>When men may be ſaid to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord; and what the meaning is, to be partakers of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be aſhamed of the teſtimony of Chriſt, I conceive ſignifieth two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To be aſhamed, or afraid to give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto Chriſt, and to the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> to be afraid to give a teſtimony of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the oppoſition of men is a great ſin; it is contrary to the precept. <hi>Fear not them who can kill the body, and can do no more, but fear him that is able to caſt Body and Soul into Hell-fire</hi>— but to be aſhamed of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is a greater ſin; becauſe the temptation is higher under the former, then under the latter; to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of Chriſt, is to decline, to own, and profeſs Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; when there is no great danger that threatneth us in ſuch a Profeſſion, we have <hi>an High-Prieſt that can have compaſſion upon our infirmities</hi>— but when no ſuch danger threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a man, only he may ſuffer a little in his honour and repute amongſt men, and they may not have ſo good an opinion of him, &amp; for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61091:53"/> this to decline the publick owning and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſing of Chriſt, it muſt needs be a very great ſin; it is a dreadful Text, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me and my words in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels.</hi> For a man to be afraid to own Chriſt and his Goſpel, and the profeſſion of it, when utmoſt danger threatneth him, is ſin enough; it arguing that the fear of man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in him above the fear of God; but for a man, when no ſuch danger threatneth him, to be aſhamed, and to think it beneath him to own the Goſpel, and to love the honour that is from men, before the honour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God, is a very dreadful tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That man is aſhamed of the teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>That is aſhamed of others, for the teſtimony which they bear to Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I muſt confeſs, I think this is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here chiefly intendeth, <hi>Paul</hi> was now a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> the condition of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners you know, is a low and contemptible condition, now for a perſon to be aſhamed to be a friend, or companion, or to own the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, and acquaintance with any, becauſe they are giving a teſtimony to Chriſt, and for that teſtimony are hated, maligned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, is to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, It is reported of that famous Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, that he would often kiſs the hole of <hi>Paphnutius</hi>'s eye, that was bored out for the profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61091:54"/>
               <p>What is the meaning of the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>— <hi>Be thou partaker of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Goſpel</hi>—</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively; it doth not imply that it is the will of God, that any man ſhould throw himſelf into the afflictions of the Goſpel, the beſt of afflictions are trials and temptations, no man ought to pull trials upon himſelf, we read indeed of ſome in the Primitive times that offered themſelves to the ſtake, and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. themſelves to be Chriſtians, ambitious of the Crown of Martyrdom, but theſe things are <hi>miranda,</hi> to be admired, not <hi>imitanda,</hi> to be imitated; no man is bound to put his ſelf upon ſuffering afflictions, no not in defence of the Goſpel of Chriſt, we ought to ſee our call clear to ſuffering, as well as doing; in that ſenſe therefore this precept muſt not be underſtood. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſpeaketh unto every Chriſtian <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that his owning and profeſſing of the Goſpel, ſhould meet with afflictions;</hi> and to be content to take a ſhare in them, <hi>Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel</hi> — look that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be afflicted, and be contented to take thy ſhare with the Goſpel in its afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; our Saviour telleth us; <hi>That no Prince goeth out to war with another, but he firſt ſitteth down, and conſidereth whether he with</hi> 10000 <hi>ſhall be able to meet with his enemy with</hi> 20000. Chriſtians; before men undertake the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel, they ought to ſit down and conſider what the Goſpel will coſt them; for the tempers of our ſpirits under divine
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61091:54"/> providences, are much according to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; if we expect nothing but good, and meet with nothing but evil, the evil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us, we did not look for it, <hi>Mala inopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata graviora;</hi> but this is not all, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take our part in afflictions with the Goſpel, if God calleth us to ſuffer for own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſing the Goſpel of Chriſt, and not think it ſtrange; we ſhould not murmure and repine againſt it, or take any unlawful courſe to decline; but to caſt our lot with Profeſſors, and to take our ſhare with them, and to be content to ſuffer evil with them, who ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, or for the profeſſion of any of his truths; nay, it may be there is ſomething more our duty than this; and that is, <hi>to rejoice that we are counted worthy to ſuffer any thing for the name of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> Acts 5.41. Singing in the priſon into which we are thrown, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did; <hi>taking the ſpoiling of our goods with joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, there is ſomething more in this phraſe, <hi>viz. a ſuffering together with others that ſuffer for the Goſpel, though we do not ſuffer at all,</hi> and indeed this is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; we ought to have a ſympathy with the Goſpel, and the Profeſſors of it, it is that which the Apoſtle urgeth, and thus it anſwereth that text <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Rejoice with them that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and weep with them that weep:</hi> both theſe are put together in that phraſe, in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>For you had compaſſion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods</hi>— Both theſe are the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61091:55"/> duty of good Chriſtians; to ſuffer with them that ſuffer for the Goſpel; and to be content to ſuffer themſelves, if God calleth them to it in defence of the Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; as the Apoſtle had upon him the care of all the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. So he had upon him the ſorrow and affliction of all the Church of Chriſt; the Apoſtle in that Chap. <hi>v,</hi> 23. telleth us what ſtripes, what impriſonments, what deaths he was in; and then he telleth us, that he did not thus only ſuffer with, and for the Goſpel, but alſo <hi>he was afflicted, and he burned with others;</hi> and this is the duty of every Chriſtian, they ought to partake joyfully, and with ſatisfaction to take their ſhare in thoſe afflictions, to which the preaching or owning the Goſpel doth expoſe them, and alſo to bear the burthens of others, and to be content to ſuffer with them, to bear ſome ſhare in their ſorrow; in their trials and afflictions. I come to the next queſtion.</p>
               <p>Qu. 4. <hi>Whence ariſeth this obligation upon Chriſtians; and why are they thus to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the afflictions of the Goſpel, and not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Queſtion hath two Branches.</p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>Whence ariſeth this obligation upon them not to be aſhamed to give this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor of it when given?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Whence ariſeth this obligation upon Chriſtians to be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe; whence this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ariſe upon Chriſtians not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61091:55"/> of the teſtimony of our Lord? I ſhall open it to you in ſeven or eight particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From the will of God.</hi> This is the true and proper foundation of all duty; the will of God, and the duty of Chriſtians are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relates; nothing can be our duty towards God, but what is the will of God towards us, and nothing can be the will of God towards us, but it muſt become our duty; this is the will of God; it is the will of God that we ſhould not be aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord; neither our ſelves, to give teſtimony unto Chriſt nor his Goſpel, nor yet of them who do give ſuch teſtimony. It is indeed the will of God concerning ſome more eminently then others; but concerning all Chriſtians, it is the will of God; it is ſpoken concerning all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 10.32. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> The Apoſtle writeth to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.3. <hi>That no man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions, for your ſelves know that we are appointed thereunto,</hi> Col. 4.12. It is the duty of Chriſtians <hi>to be compleat in all the will of God.</hi> It is not only the will of God that men ſhould pray, that they hear the word, and receive the Sacrament, but they ſhould give their teſtimony, and not be aſhamed of the teſtimony of Chriſt their Lord, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions</hi>—
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61091:56"/> 2 Tim. 2.3. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Miniſters and good Chriſtians are witneſſes; and they are Soldiers, and therefore they ought to endure hardneſs, and to be ready to give their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeareth from the relation that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Chriſtian ſtandeth in to Chriſt as his Lord; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; mark the words, <hi>that thou be not aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſubject is bound to give his teſtimony for the King, becauſe he is his Soveraign Lord; every Servant is bound to give his teſtimony for his Maſter, becauſe he is his Lord: Chriſt is our Lord, and therefore there lieth an obligation upon us to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for him; would not your Prince take it ill, if you ſhould refuſe being called, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the truth for him? &amp; would not your Maſter take it ill, if you ſhould refuſe to give your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for him? Surely Chriſt, who is our Lord, muſt take it ill from us, if we refuſe a teſtimony to him. If every man, becauſe that he is a debtor to the truth, taketh himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the law of Charity to give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth for his Neighbour, when his eſtate, or his life is concerned, or any thing of his intereſt: and every Subject taketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more highly concerned to give his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth on the behalf of his Prince, or on the behalf of his Maſter, becauſe there is a relation betwixt the Prince and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and betwixt the Maſter and the Servant; certainly there muſt needs lie an obligation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61091:56"/> upon every Chriſtian who owneth Chriſt as his Soveraign Lord and Maſter, to give a teſtimony unto Chriſt; it is a teſtimony for the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, for him whom we call our Father, whom we own as our Maſter; every Teſtimony to the Goſpel, and the truth of the Goſpel is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to Chriſt; every teſtimony for Chriſt, is a teſtimony for him, who is our Lord, and whom we own, and avow to be our Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This obligation ariſeth <hi>from that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which we all owe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> every one looketh upon himſelf indebted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who hath done him good; and there is nothing more uſual in that caſe, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a requital, and to expreſs a trouble that we know not how to make him or her amends, and to expreſs our willingneſs to it; the teſtimony of our Lord, is the teſtimony of him who left his Fathers Throne, and came down upon the Earth, and clothed himſelf with our nature, and died in our ſtead, that we might not periſh for ever &amp; ever, he aſcending up into Heaven, hath left us in charge with his truth, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.27. —<hi>ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel,</hi> Jude, v. 3. —<hi>that you ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> Now which of you, if you had but an ordinary friend like your ſelves, who had done you ſome great and eminent kindneſs, and left you in charge but to give a teſtimony unto him and for him, ſhould not think your ſelves under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it! Oh! how great is the obligation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61091:57"/> which lieth upon every Chriſtian that liveth in the world to bear his teſtimony for Chriſt, if he doth but conſider what Jeſus Chriſt hath done for him; ſhall Chriſt come and die for us, love not his life unto death, and ſhall we be aſhamed to give a teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, or to be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel of our deareſt Lord, this ought not to be; if the kindneſs of a man layeth an obligation upon us, to do what in us lieth to ſerve him; ſurely the kindneſs of the Lord our Saviour layeth a much higher obligation upon us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing from whence this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation doth ariſe, is <hi>from the duty incumbent upon us to be conformable unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we ought to ſtudy a conformity to him in his life, and in his death; in his life he commandeth us to <hi>be holy as he is holy;</hi> in his <hi>death,</hi> thus the Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>for a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings. For this cauſe was I born, and for this cauſe did I come into the world, that I might bear witneſs unto the truth;</hi> and it is particularly ſaid of him, <hi>that before</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>he witneſſed a good confeſſion,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.13. He endured affliction in the firſt publication of the Goſpel; what was the teſtimony Chriſt gave but this? that there were a people in the world who were very dear to him, choſen unto eternal life for him, though he was the eternal Son of God, thought fit to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with fleſh, and to die upon the Croſs, that he might redeem this people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; now it is our duty to be conformable to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61091:57"/> Chriſt, conformable to this teſtimony, not being aſhamed of this teſtimonony, conformable alſo in not being aſhamed of Affliction; this yet is advantaged by another conſideration: that we are to fill up the Afflictions of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt.</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt are either thoſe things which he ſuffered in his own perſon: Now concerning them, he ſaid, <hi>all is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (the <hi>Papiſts</hi> vainly dream of the filling up of thoſe ſufferings;) or elſe thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which every good Chriſtian ſhall ſuffer in his Myſtical Body to the end of the World, and there is much behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt, which we are to fill up, and filling them up, we act both in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto Chriſt, who is our Head, and alſo unto the multitude of the Churches that have gone before us, who have taſted of this Cup, and drank a little of it, but there is much more of theſe that is yet to be filled up.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Obligation ariſeth upon Chriſtians <hi>from the nature of the Goſpel, and the truths of it,</hi> to which we give our Teſtimony. I have told you before in this Diſcourſe, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man and Woman is a Debtor to truth, no Man ought to decline a Teſtimony unto truth; but now by how much any truths are of greater moment, of greater weight and importance, by ſo much we are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Debtors to them; you have the ſubſtance
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61091:58"/> of the Goſpel in that one Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi> He ſaid true, who ſaid that Chriſtians could better want the Sun in the Firmament, than that one piece of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; the truths of the Goſpel are of that high importance, that the comfort and peace of all the Souls of the People of God in this Life, and the eternal Salvation of the Souls of all People in the Life to come, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſtability of them; if the truths of the Goſpel did not ſtand firm and fixed, the Souls of Chriſtians are undone to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there is no foundation of peace for them in this Life, there is no hope of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation for them in that Life which is to come: We ſtand therefore highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give a Teſtimony to theſe truths; and to be partakers of afflictions in giving a Teſtimony to thoſe truths, and to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, upon which ſo much of our eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and concern doth lye, there is no truth but we owe a Teſtimony to it, but there are ſome Propoſitions of Truth, that are not of that moment, that we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure affliction for the juſtification of them; but the truths of the Goſpel are of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that no Teſtimony we can give to them can be too high no affliction we can ſuffer for them, can be too great.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Sixth Obligation that lyeth upon Chriſtians, is from the ſtation they take up in the World; I ſhall here inlarge upon Three things;

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Every Chriſtian is the Child of God, the Servant of God, the Member of Chriſt, now ſhould a Child be aſhamed to atteſt the truth for his Father? or ſhould a Servant be aſhamed to atteſt the truth for his Maſter? or ſhould a Member be aſhamed to atteſt the truth for its Head? ſhould the Tongue be aſhamed to ſpeak for the Head? Which of you that are Parents, if you had a Child that ſhould be aſhamed (if called) to ſpeak the truth for you, would not diſown ſuch a Child? There is never a Chriſtian but is the Son or the Daughter of God, the Child of God; and his relation to God doth oblige him not to be aſhamed of this Teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="7">7. Another Obligation that is upon us, is from thoſe private Laws that we have laid upon our ſelves; and that two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>our Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By <hi>our Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are all Baptized, and the Apoſtle ſaith, we are <hi>Baptized into Chriſt;</hi> one part of the ſenſe of which is, that we are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the profeſſion of Chriſt; no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is Baptized, but he taketh a Vow upon him to be the Lord's Servant; beſides, <hi>our profeſſion</hi> is another <hi>private Law</hi> that we have laid upon our ſelves; the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is an Obligation upon us to act for Chriſt, and to ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Preſs-mony you know obligeth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fight for his Prince; there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61091:59"/> but beſides the general Laws that are laid upon him, hath layed a private Law upon himſelf, both by his Vow and Promiſe in Baptiſm, and by his taking upon him the name of a Chriſtian; how doth he deſerve the name of a Chriſtian, that is aſhamed of the Teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; how doth he anſwer his Vow in Baptiſm, that refuſeth to fight under the Lords Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to give a Teſtimony unto Chriſt, when he is called thereunto.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There lyeth a great Obligation upon us <hi>from our duty of conformity to our Fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> we are not only the Members of Chriſt, but are alſo <hi>Members one of another, Epheſ.</hi> 4.25. <hi>For we are Members one of another.</hi> The Church of Chriſt from the beginning of the World, unto the end of it will be but one, and we ought to be as Members like one another, ſo that the example of the Saints and Servants of God in all Ages, who have ſtood up in teſtimony of the Goſpel, or who have been partakers of the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel, layeth an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to go and do likewiſe; that as we might have a fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death, and in his Teſtimony, and his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo that we might be conformable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Saints and Servants of God which have been before us, and to their Teſtimony; <hi>John</hi> glorieth in this, and putteth into his Titles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> —He calleth himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 9. — <hi>Their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p n="9">9. A Ninth Obligation that is upon us, not to be aſhamed of this Teſtimony of our Lord; is the <hi>reward that ſuch ſhall have, who ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> and the danger they run that are aſhamed. I will put both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; becauſe the proof of them lieth in the ſame Texts, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful Generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with the Holy Angels,</hi> Matth. 10.33, <hi>But whoſoever ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me before Men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Luke 12.8. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before Men, him ſhall the Son of Man alſo confeſs before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God.</hi> The danger lieth here, that if we be aſhamed of Chriſt, he will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of us; if we deny him, he will deny us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him; if we deny him, he will alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61091:60"/> us.</hi> The reward you ſee is, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> If we confeſs him, he will alſo own, confeſs, and acknowledge us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father which is in Heaven; this I take to be what every one will grant, that by the very Law of Nature every one is bound to decline that which will bring evil upon him, and to do that which will bring him any valuable and conſiderable good; ſo that let us but conſider the danger of Chriſt's diſowning us, and the good of Chriſts owning us at the day of Judgment; and we ſhall eaſily underſtand what Obligation lieth upon us, not to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord; and to be ready to give our Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to him, and to the Goſpel; but may ſome ſay, who are thoſe whom Chriſt will own or diſown at the laſt day, and how will Chriſt diſown Men in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you may underſtand it from ſome Texts, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 25.31, 32, 33, 34. Our Saviour telleth us, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord! Lord! have we not propheſied in thy Name? And in thy Name have caſt out Devils. — And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me you workers of Iniquity.</hi> And in that Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 15.27. —<hi>Ye begin
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61091:61"/> to ſtand without, and to knock at the Door, ſaying, Lord! Lord! open unto us, and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are:</hi> v. 27. — <hi>Depart from me all ye work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity, then ſhall be weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Conſider this, we all muſt once dye, and after Death come to Judgment; if Men have here diſowned Chriſt and his Goſpel, and ſhall then cry, Lord! Lord! open to us, open the Kingdom of Heaven, do not caſt us out of thy ſight for ever; Chriſt will then ſay to that Man who hath been aſhamed of his Teſtimony: No, Thou wert aſhamed to own me, and my deſpiſed Perſecuted Truths and Servants, now I will not own thee. Chriſt will ſay to him depart from me, I know you not; but what is it for Chriſt to own a Man? You may learn that from that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, come you Bleſſed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the World.</hi> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with your ſelves, doth not there lye upon a Man an Obligation to ſave his own Soul, and to keep himſelf out of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burning; the ſame Obligation lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Men not to be aſhamed of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Lord; but to be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel; the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that the Law of nature layeth upon every Man to look to his higheſt concern, the ſaving his Soul, the keeping himſelf in favour with God; I ſhall add but one thing more.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61091:61"/>10. The laſt thing from whence this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation doth ariſe, is <hi>from the oneneſs of the Body of Chriſt:</hi> This ſhould engage us to ſuffer evil together with the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the faithful Profeſſors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; that we may ſhew our ſelves to be true Members of Chriſts myſtical Body: We ſee in a natural Body, it is impoſſible that one Member ſhould ſuffer and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the reſt will feel it, though they may not feel that particular pain, which it may be doth fix only in this or that Member, yet there is affliction in the whole Body; the whole Body is diſquieted and troubled, though only the Head aketh, or the Tooth, or the like; ſo will it be in the myſtical Body of Chriſt, though it may be there are but ſome particular Members of the Body that do ſuffer, yet there will be never a Member of that Body but will ſuffer a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy; every Chriſtian will not be ſlain, will not be impriſoned, or plundered, but if any of them be ſo evil intreated, all the reſt that are true Members of this Body, will feel ſomething of the ſuffering of thoſe Members that do ſuffer; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is any Man afflicted, and I burn not?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Philip, 4.14, 15. <hi>Notwithſtanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction,</hi> v. 15. <hi>No Church communicated with me as concerning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and receiving, but you only.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh thereas you may judge by the 15th. Verſe, of a Communicating by giving and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61091:62"/> receiving; but this was the fruit of the other; the <hi>Philippians</hi> Sympathized with St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his afflictions, and felt his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and this made them to communicate with him in that ſtate by relieving of him, and indeed thoſe Profeſſors that do not ſo communicate with the afflicted Children of God, give a very ill proof that they are the true Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt; I have opened the Doctrine to you. Let us now conſider what improvement may be made of it.</p>
               <p>Uſe 1. What you have heard reflecteth ſadly upon them, who refuſe to give a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Lord: Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are aſhamed of thoſe who do give this Teſtimony. You have heard how many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations there are upon us to it; but how few are there who are ſenſible of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations?</p>
               <p n="1">1. How many are aſhamed of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Lord! aſhamed to own thoſe truths which their Lord owned; thoſe truths for the Teſtimony of which their Lord died, St. <hi>Paul</hi> glorieth of himſelf, that he was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for, ſaith he, <hi>It is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> Heb. 11.16. — <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> Heb. 2.11. —<hi>Chriſt is not aſhamed to call them Brethren:</hi> Shall a poor Worm be aſhamed to be called the Child of God, or the Servant of God, to be called a Godly Man or Woman; how many Profeſſors had we ſome years ſince,

We may ſay of our times, as the Apoſtle ſaid to the Hebrews; <hi>None hath yet reſiſted unto Blood</hi> — and yet how few have we that do reſiſt ſtriving againſt Sin; I tremble to think of that Text, —<hi>Whoſoever is aſhamed of me before Men, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed.</hi> We have too many that think it enough to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> to <hi>read;</hi> but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this piece of their duty; to bear a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to our Lord; nay how many are there, who are aſhamed of thoſe who do give their Teſtimony; aſhamed of the Chains, and Bonds, and Impriſonments, and reproaches of the Miniſters and People of God; they are not only aſhamed to own the Teſtimony of the Goſpel themſelves, and to come in as Witneſſes for Chriſt, but they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them who do; but I hope I ſpeak to none here who are of that Complexion.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. It may be ſome will ſay, how ſhall I know if I walk up to my duty in this particular; if I be not aſhamed of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my Lord; and be a partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel? I ſhall give you two or three notes, which are ſufficient for this diſcovery:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When the diſcredit of the Goſpel, maketh us neither to think it beneath us to own the truth, of the Goſpel, nor thoſe who own and profeſs it.</hi> There is a time when the Goſpel hath a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the World; the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>When no temptation can prevail upon as to live a Converſation contrary to the Goſpel.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is obliged to give a double Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Lord; a vocal Teſtimony, and a real Teſtimony; we give a real Teſtimony unto Chriſt, when we dare practically live up to the avowed truths of the Goſpel in the vileſt and worſt of times; it is true we are obliged to a vocal as well as a real. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and a good Chriſtian doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty in giving teſtimony to the Goſpel, by a meer living up to the Rules of it; there is ſomething more required of a Chriſtian than this: But it is as true that neither doth a Chriſtian give a Teſtimony to the Goſpel, that openly profeſſeth and owneth it in the face of its enemies,

               <p>Uſe 3. In the laſt place, Let me perſwade with you a little for this duty of not being aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord, nor of any of his Priſoners, and being partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Not to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of our Lord: Now in ſpeaking to this branch of Application, I will enquire:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To what of Chriſt this Teſtimony is due;</hi> whether to all Propoſitions concerning Chriſt, or to ſome only?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What kind of Teſtimony it muſt be;</hi> that it may be accepted of the Lord?</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. To what of Chriſt is this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony due?</p>
               <p>The proper Object of a Teſtimony, is a <hi>Propoſition</hi> or a Fact, the truth of one or the other: Now the Propoſitions that relate unto Chriſt are of ſeveral natures, of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natures, and of different moment: Some concern the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> ſome concern the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> ſome concern the <hi>Kingly Office of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſome concern the <hi>Rule of a Chriſtians Life:</hi> I know no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Goſpel, but a Chriſtian is a debter to, and ought to bear a Teſtimony
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61091:65"/> unto; but yet they are not all of equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the nature of <hi>Propoſitions</hi> doth very much differ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>According to what doth depend upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>According to the evidence that they have in Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>According to what dependeth upon them.</hi> Some Propoſitions of truth are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; look as it is with the foundation of a Houſe, take it away and the whole Building tumbleth to the ground: So there are ſome Propoſitions of the Goſpel, that the whole Fabrick of Goſpel truths lieth upon them, the whole Body of truth is built upon them; here now the Obligation of our Teſtimony lieth higher, and riſeth higher and further, but there is no truth that we are not debtors unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>According to the evidence that they have in the Goſpel;</hi> there are different apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning truth, for although the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath revealed all truth, yet not all with the ſame evidence, ſo that Chriſtians have differed concerning truth, and every man as he believeth, ſo he ought to ſpeak, ſo he ought to live; but the apprehenſions that ſome men have had, that they are bound to give a Teſtimony to every Propoſition of truth which they do in heart imbrace, hath begot a great deal of ſtir; the Apoſtle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth another Rule when he ſaith, <hi>Haſt thou Faith? Have it to thy ſelf before God:</hi> There are ſome Propoſitions of which a Chriſtian may have a particular perſwaſion, and of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61091:66"/> which he may be very confident of the truth of them, but yet they will not bear the weight of a Teſtimony to the diſturbance of the Church of Chriſt; now a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to regulate his Teſtimony accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What kind of Teſtimony is that, which a good Chriſtian is bound to give unto the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will open this to you in ſeven or eight particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He ought to give a knowing, believing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony;</hi> there is a Teſtimony of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a Teſtimony of <hi>Faction;</hi> that Man giveth a Teſtimony of Faith, that doth in his Heart believe what he with his Mouth confeſſeth, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as he believeth ſo he ſpeaketh:</hi> So in this caſe a Chriſtian muſt ſpeak as he believeth, and when he ſpeaketh and owneth, and defendeth a truth, becauſe he believeth it to be the eternal truth of God, this is a <hi>Teſtimony of Faith;</hi> but then there is a Teſtimony of Faction when a man runs with a multitude to atteſt a truth, and crieth for it, but underſtandeth not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not what he profeſſeth; I would have every Chriſtian not to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of Chriſt, but I would have him be ſure that it be a Teſtimony of Faith that he giveth, not a Teſtimony of Faction; for a man to give a Teſtimony to truth, if it be in Faction, it is abomination to God, whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin; <hi>The word not mingled with Faith profiteth not;</hi> and a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61091:66"/> not given in Faith ſignifieth nothing: Oh! Chriſtians beware of this, that none of you in this day be factious Profeſſors, be not aſhamed of the Teſtimony of your Lord. But firſt, ſee that you underſtand it, ſee that your ſelves believe it to be a good Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; a Man or Woman will have very little peace or comfort in giving a Teſtimony to that, which either he knoweth not, or in Heart believeth not; when a Man believeth and therefore ſpeaketh, he ſpeaketh that with his Lips which his Soul hath firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and he ſeeth bottomed in the Word of God, and in Heart agreeth and aſſenteth to, this is his Teſtimony; take this note with you in every Teſtimony, let it be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or real, let it be a Teſtimony of Faith, not a Teſtimony of Faction, and a meer run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning along with a cry, like the rout of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> when <hi>Acts</hi> 19.32. <hi>Some cried one thing, ſome another, for the Aſſembly was confuſed; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be a <hi>Loving Teſtimony,</hi> or it is not accepted, Faith and Love m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61091:67"/> goods to the poor, and my Body to be burnt, if I have not love, it is all nothing.</hi> Let a man give never ſo great a Teſtimony to Chriſt, if he doth not this out of love, it is out of ſome evil principle of contradiction or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or ſome ſtubbornneſs of Spirit, and God accepteth it not; it is not a Chriſtians ſaying, I am for the true Doctrine, I am for pure Worſhip, and I am for the Kingly Government of Chriſt, but his doing this out of a true pleaſure and delight in theſe things, out of a true love to God, and zeal for the glory of God: And this is another thing that I fear in a crowd that give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in an evil time, as that ſome teſtifie they know not what, ſo that others teſtifie rather out of a principle of contradiction or fullenneſs, than out of a true principle of love to Ordinances and truths; hence you ſhall obſerve, that as in a ſerene and fair time there are a multitude of Profeſſors that are like Swallows that will ſtay with the Goſpel in its Summer time; ſo you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve there are a multitude of others that in a time of oppoſition, eſpecially when the Perſecution reacheth not high, buſie to give their Teſtimony to truth, which when they may imbrace freely they never regard, and make no conſcience of; you have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of both theſe at home; on the one ſide we had a company of Profeſſors that have now forſaken us and fled, and embraced this preſent World; in a time of temptation they are gone away, and you ſhall obſerve a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61091:67"/> of others that cried out lately for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and againſt robbing Chriſtians of the Sacrament of the Supper, the great pledge of Chriſts Love: Now that none hindreth their coming to them, they regard not the Sacrament, both theſe were ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe, they gave or thought they gave ſome teſtimony to their Lord, but their Teſtimony was equally acceptable to God, neither the one nor the other was out of a love in their heart to Chriſt, and to his truth and ordinances, but meerly out of faction and turbulency of Spirit, or for ſome baſe worldly end. I would have you own the Teſtimony of Chriſt, I would have you fear being aſhamed of it, as you would fear that Chriſt ſhould be aſhamed of you at the day of Judgment; I would have you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But be ſure you give your Teſtimony out of love, as what you know, and in heart truly believe and agree to; ſo out of a burning love and zeal in your heart to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Teſtimony ought to be a <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Teſtimony;</hi> it is one thing that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth when we ſwear that it ſhould be in truth, righteouſneſs and judgment: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth in truth, righteouſneſs and judgment:</hi> Swearing is an Atteſtation, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Atteſtation of a truth. The Teſtimony which I am now ſpeaking to is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be performed by Oath, though we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61091:68"/> ought not to refuſe if called to that, but as it muſt be to the truth, in righteouſneſs, ſo it muſt be in judgment: The judgment that I would have attend the Teſtimony of which I am now ſpeaking, is not a judgment that the thing is true, the truth of Chriſt, but that it is a truth of that nature that will bear the weight of ſuch a Teſtimony too, as it muſt bear if it bear any; for I muſt tell you, though truth, all truth be a very ſacred pin, yet every ſuch pin hath not an equal degree of ſtrength, and will not bear a like weight; I am afraid we have too loud a Teſtimony to ſome truths, which though they may have ſpoken the faith of Chriſtians, and their love, yet have not ſpoken the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſuch Teſtimonies were thoſe the Chriſtians gave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. For things that were in themſelves of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature, and yet Chriſtians on either ſide were too warm.

In his own particular practice to own it; but we ought not to make a party for every truth: Now this dependeth upon this great truth. <hi>That though there be no truth of God but we ought to own, and being convinced of to Practiſe, yet there are ſome truths of God, as to which God willeth not that we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious;</hi> For God hath given his people a Latitude in them without hazard of their Salvation, and therefore we muſt give our Teſtimony to truth with prudence, a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61091:68"/> judging of the weight and value of a truth, before we give a zealous Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Teſtimony muſt be with <hi>prudence:</hi> Prov. 8.12. <hi>I Wiſdom dwell with Prudence:</hi> Wiſdom doth often ſignify Grace, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all true Grace in a Soul ſhould dwell with Prudence, we are commanded to be <hi>wiſe as Serpents,</hi> and to <hi>walk circumſpectly not as fools,</hi>

                  <hi>but as wiſe;</hi> there is a great deal of prudence to be uſed in giving our Teſtimony to our Lord; our Lord himſelf, if you obſerve him, did it with <hi>prudence,</hi> and we ought to let our Wiſdom dwell with Prudence: This Prudence muſt not be extended ſo far, as to deny any neceſſary truth, or to diſſemble ſo as to declare our ſelves againſt it, or not to own it, for it muſt be ſuch a prudenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as is oppoſed to impiety, if there be a failure in piety, there can be no prudence: Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth not ſo much reſpect the doing, or the not doing of the thing, as the manner of the doing of it: In general we then give our Teſtimony with prudence, when we give it without any juſt offence to <hi>Jew, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> or <hi>the Church of Chriſt;</hi> a Teſtimony of our Lord may be ſpoiled by the heighth of our Spirit through pride ſhewed in judging, contemning, and deſpiſing of others, or through the boiſterouſneſs and the paſſion of our Spirits, or by our noiſe and clamours; ſo that to the prudence of a Teſtimony there are three things required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility in oppoſition to Pride:</hi> Pride is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61091:69"/> a <hi>Colloquintida</hi> that maketh all our Meſſes of duty and Service to God bitter; God abhorreth the proud, he abhorreth a haughty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Spirit, he giveth grace to the humble, and he accepteth his Teſtimony. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. <hi>He ſerved the Lord with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of mind. — We are bid to put on humility of mind,</hi> — Col. 3.12. and 1 Pet. 5.5. <hi>To be clothed with humility.</hi> — Humility is our garment, a Chriſtian muſt do nothing but in humility; in what he doth in the ſervice of God, there muſt be a vein of humility, and in that part of our ſervice to God where humility is wanting, in that part a Chriſtian always walketh naked, and Men ſee his ſhame, a faſtidious, ſcornful contemning ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, is no Chriſtian ſufferer.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Another thing is <hi>meekneſs with reſpect to paſſion:</hi> This is often called for, we are bid to put it on, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. And the Miniſter is to inſtruct in meekneſs thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The Apoſtle beſeecheth you by the weakneſs of Chriſt; meekneſs is oppoſed to frowardneſs and paſſion; a paſſionate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to a truth is at beſt but an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and indiſcreet Teſtimony; <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third thing that commendeth a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is courteſy, in oppoſition to moroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſoureneſs; when <hi>Feſtus</hi> told <hi>Paul, That much Learning had made him mad,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I am not mad moſt noble</hi> Feſtus: Obſerve with how much complement <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Feſtus</hi> and others, while he was bearing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61091:69"/> teſtimony unto the truth of God; the ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and moroſity of a Chriſtians beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in bearing his teſtimony, maketh his teſtimony more unlovely, and not ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as it ought to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Fourth thing is <hi>peaceableneſs:</hi> The Servants of God muſt not ſtrive; there is nothing more aſperſeth the Goſpel, and the Profeſſion of it, then the imprudence of a Profeſſor of it in the managery of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your Teſtimony unto God muſt be <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> it cannot be uniform if it be not ſincere; the teſtimony of the Life muſt agree with the teſtimony of the Lips; you know a Witneſs that contradicteth his teſtimony, doth by it make his teſtimony invalid; he that liveth contrary to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, giveth himſelf the lye; he teſtifieth with his Lips, but he denieth in his Life. The Apoſtle telleth us of ſome, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. <hi>They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</hi> You ſhall obſerve therefore, that when the Devil at any time gave a teſtimony to a Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt and the Apoſtles, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly refuſed and would not hear him ſpeak, the teſtimony of one of the Children of the Devil, is rather a diſhonour and weakning of the Truth, than any ſtrengthning and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and confirmation; a Man that is Holy in his Life, bearing teſtimony with his Lips, is a great Servant of God; he by his Mouth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61091:70"/> declareth what he believeth; and by his Life he declareth that he doth indeed not mock and diſſemble with the World; but he believeth what he profeſſeth to believe: You ſhall ſee in ſome caſes, ſome fooliſh Witneſſes do more hurt than good; ſo a Chriſtian may do more miſchief than good to the Goſpel of Chriſt, by his owning of it, and profeſſing to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let it be a <hi>bold and undaunted Teſtimony,</hi> he is a good Witneſs in a cauſe, who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>modeſtly,</hi> and with all <hi>due reſpect to thoſe, to whom he giveth his Teſtimony,</hi> and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth; and doth not contradict himſelf, and yet is <hi>bold and couragious, ſpeaking with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> hence you ſhall find that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is often uſed about the teſtimony that the Apoſtles did bear to the truth; a free, bold teſtimony in any cauſe doth it great ſervice, while the ſtammering liſping Witneſs, that uſeth no freedom in his Speech, rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a cauſe, than doth it good; the Scripture ſpeaketh much of, and commendeth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians boldneſs; a <hi>boldneſs</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a <hi>boldneſs</hi> in a <hi>bearing teſtimony to our Lord;</hi> when we are not afraid of the Faces of men that would outface the truths of God; a Chriſtian ſhould be bold in the Faith, <hi>bold in Prayer,</hi> and bold <hi>in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Let your Teſtimony be a <hi>hearty teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> a <hi>free, ready, chearful teſtimony;</hi> God loveth a <hi>chearful giver,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) indeed in all our Gifts unto God, it is ſo:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61091:70"/> God loveth a freedom and chearfulneſs of Spirit, we ſhould not be <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> into a Teſtimony to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, indeed we are <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> by that dreadful Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. A Chriſtian ſhould give a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony freely, not to provoke and challenge danger, and dare a Trial, but when he ſeeth ſuffering at hand, ſo that God calleth him to give a <hi>teſtimony</hi> to him, and to the truths of the Goſpel, then chearfulneſs becometh a Chriſtian, chearfulneſs as it is oppoſed to grudging.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I will add but one thing more, it ſhould be a <hi>patient Teſtimony,</hi> Rev. 19 St. <hi>John</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this Character of himſelf; <hi>I</hi> John <hi>who alſo am your Brother and Companion in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the Kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> — Patience under evils is what is often called for in Scripture, and preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Servants of God, with a great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Arguments; by a patient Teſtimony I underſtand three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A patient continuance in the Teſtimony of Chriſt;</hi> a flitting, and incertain Chriſtian in the truths of God, who is of one mind to day, and another mind to morrow, is no good Witneſs in the cauſe of Chriſt, <hi>ſemper idem</hi> is the true <hi>Motto</hi> of every Chriſtian, of every ſuch Witneſs, he that is one day of one mind, another day of another, like a Wave of the Sea toſſed about, may poſſibly get to Heaven at laſt, as through fire, but he is no good Witneſs for Chriſt; you know amongſt men a good Witneſs muſt abide by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61091:71"/> his <hi>teſtimony;</hi> if he varieth, his <hi>teſtimony</hi> is weakned: Therefore Chriſtians are highly concerned to examine <hi>Propoſitions</hi> well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they profeſs them, and when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, to think well with themſelves before they part with them; a man never is a good witneſs for the Lord in that point, wherein he hath been incertain himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be a <hi>patient teſtimony</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>unto thoſe affronts which he</hi> may ſuffer from men, while he is giving his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a good and ſteady Witneſs in your Courts is not moved by the affronts of any Lawyer that ſetteth himſelf to baffle him out of his Teſtimony; he that is a good Witneſs in the cauſe of Chriſt, muſt not be affected at the affronts of Men that would baffle him out of his Teſtimony; he muſt be patient both as to the flatteries and enticements of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and alſo as to their frowns and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A patient Teſtimony muſt be a <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony attended with that patience, which they had need of, who may ſuffer for giving their Teſtimony;</hi> for though no Man ought to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for bearing Witneſs to the truth, yet there is nothing more ordinary then for men and women to ſuffer for giving a Teſtimony unto truth; and thus now I have ſhewed you, what kind of Teſtimony it is, that every good Chriſtian is bound to give unto the Lord. I have but two things more to do; firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to it by ſome Arguments; then to direct you in the fulfilling of it; now for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61091:71"/> Arguments to perſwade you not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Teſtimony of Chriſt, you have heard enough already; I have ſhewed you a Ten-fold Obligation lying upon you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember Chriſt is your Lord?</p>
               <p n="3">3. You cannot otherwiſe ſhew your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, for that Teſtimony which he gave for you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus you ſhall be conformable unto Chriſt, and what is behind of the ſuffering of Chriſt, ſhall be filled up in you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Remember the nature of the Goſpel, and of the truths of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider the Station which you take up in the World, of a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> a <hi>Souldier,</hi> a <hi>Child</hi> to our Heavenly Father, a <hi>Servant</hi> to a Heavenly Maſter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Remember the private Law that you have laid upon your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Remember the duty which lieth upon you to be conformable to your fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Remember the danger of forbearing, and the reward of your giving this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Conſider your oneneſs with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, after all theſe, what need any further Arguments; yet becauſe we are of our ſelves not forward unto this, our Hearts are awk, and backward to the partaking of the affliction of the Goſpel, and averſe to the giving of this Teſtimony; let me by way of a further Argument in this cauſe,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61091:72"/> name to you, and preſs upon you the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Apoſtle uſeth in this place, and by which he himſelf preſſeth this <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt lieth in thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>according to the power of God:</hi> One great diſcouragement that is upon our Spirits to keep us in a day of Teſtimony, that we ſhould not teſtify, is <hi>the fear we ſhould never be able to ſpeak and to give our Teſtimony.</hi> To give a Teſtimony for our Lord is a noble thing, to receive a Crown, the Crown of Martyrdom, is a great dignity. But when the Lord by his providence ſeeketh out for us, to ſet this Crown upon our Heads, we too frequently hide our ſelves, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, we diſtruſt our ſelves, but Chriſtian! fear not, we ſhall have the power of God; it is a wonderful thing to obſerve, that the power of God hath been ſo ſeen in no other thing as in this; you read of a Teſtimony that <hi>Stephen</hi> gave to the Goſpel: Firſt a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> then a <hi>real</hi> Teſtimony, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>And they were not able to reſiſt the Wiſdom, and the ſpirit by which he ſpake, Stephen</hi> had then a diſpute with the <hi>Libertines.</hi> The power and preſence of God from the beginning of the Goſpel hath been ſeen in nothing more, than in Gods aſſiſtance of his Witneſſes, you have a promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.12. <hi>For the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in the ſame hour, what you ought to ſay,</hi> Matth. 10.19, 20. <hi>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61091:72"/> hour, what you ſhall ſpeak. For it is not you that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your heavenly Father which ſpeaketh in you. Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>When they bring you unto the Synagogues, and unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and powers, take no thought how or what thing you ſhall anſwer, or what you ſhall ſay, for the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in that ſame hour what you ought to ſay.</hi> It is a promiſe that ſome have applied to the aſſiſtance of God in the performance of other duties, as Prayer, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it may be there hath been but an ill uſe made of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; the promiſe in the firſt place mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly relateth to a <hi>time of teſtimony,</hi> I do not ſay but there is a <hi>dabitur in hora,</hi> which thoſe who are much with God in Prayer, and which the Miniſters of the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not that ſo much, as it reſpecteth men in confeſſion, and their Teſtimony for Chriſt; in giving our Teſtimony for Chriſt, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſhall aſſiſt, words ſhall be given us in that hour, and courage and ſtrength ſhall be given us in that hour, you ſhall not give a Teſtimony for the Goſpel, you ſhall not ſuffer affliction for the Goſpel in your own ſtrength, it ſhall be <hi>according to the power of God,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you</hi> what to ſay, and what to do, and you ſhall experience that it is not you that ſpeak and act, but the Spirit that dwelleth in you, what you do in this caſe ſhall be <hi>according to the power of God,</hi> you ſhall not ſpend meerly upon your own Stock, you ſhall ſpend upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61091:73"/> Chriſts Stock when you are upon Chriſts Service, you ſhall ſpend upon the fulneſs of the Spirit of God; and there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny experiences of thoſe that could never find the preſence of God ſo ſtrong in the conſolation of their Spirits, as in that hour; be not therefore aſhamed of the Teſtimony of your Lord, for not only the thing which you teſtify, is the Teſtimony of the Lord, but your action in teſtifying, the teſtimony which you give ſhall be from the Lord, the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in you; ſo that this is a great Argument, it is a ſtanding up for Chriſt, and the Spirit of God ſhall uſe your tongue and your hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Argument the Apoſtle uſeth, is <hi>fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the nature of the truth to which you te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, and the perſon for whom you teſtify:</hi> You teſtify for the <hi>truth,</hi> which <hi>bringeth eternal Salvation;</hi> you teſtify for him, <hi>who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you with an holy calling,</hi> and he hath done this freely, not according to your works, but <hi>according to his own grace,</hi> for him who hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to Salvation.</hi> I told you before, that every one is a <hi>debtor</hi> unto truth, there is ſuch a cognation betwixt a rational Soul and Truth, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational Soul is a debtor to truth, he is a debtor to own the truth as to himſelf, and to own the truth as to another; and I told you by how much a truth is of higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61091:73"/> to our or anothers intereſt, by ſo much a Man or Woman is a greater debtor, a Man is a debtor to the truth, when it concerneth but his honour and reputation, and when it concerneth his eſtate; but much more when it concerneth Life; and ſo when it is for his Brother, by how much his Brother is more concerned, by ſo much he is more obliged; and as the nature of the truth raiſeth his obligation, ſo the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon increaſeth it; a Man is bound by the Law of charity to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth, on the behalf of his Neighbour, much more on the behalf of his <hi>Brother,</hi> and higher yet on the behalf of his <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> that begat him and brought him forth, but yet his obligation riſeth higher when it is for his <hi>Saviour,</hi> for him who hath done him the greateſt kindneſs that ever was done, without which he had better never have been born; ſuch is the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> that we are bound to give unto Chriſt: The truth is of higheſt import, the perſon is of the higheſt concern: Oh! be not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the power of God to your Salvation, of the Goſpel, which bringeth Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light, you teſtify for Chriſt who Witneſſed a good confeſſion before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> who hath done more for you than all the friends you ever had in the World could do, for him who hath called you with an holy calling; this is another Argument to enforce this Exhortation, the conſideration
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61091:74"/> for whom and for what this Teſtimony is given.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Argument which the Apoſtle bringeth here to perſwade <hi>Timothy</hi> not to be aſhamed of this Teſtimony, is <hi>his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> v. 12. <hi>For the which cauſe, I alſo ſuffer theſe things, nevertheleſs I am not aſhamed.</hi> — The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God.</hi> And he ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He is not aſhamed to call us Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen:</hi> Shall we be aſhamed to teſtify his truth? Shall we be aſhamed of the name of his Witneſſes? And obſerve the reaſon why the Apoſtle ſaith he is not aſhamed. <hi>I am not aſhamed, for I know in whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let me uſe one Argument further with you; Bleſſed be God, we yet can ſay, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. <hi>You have not yet reſiſted unto Blood, ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi> There are divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that Text to make a Chriſtian va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in his ſpiritual fight.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>a Chriſtians fight is againſt ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>in this fight of Chriſtians againſt ſin, we ought, (if called to it) to reſiſt unto Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By how much the leſſer the Trial is, that God calleth to us to undergo, by ſo much the greater obligation is upon us to endure it;</hi> all a Chriſtians fight and ſtriving is againſt ſin: He giveth a Teſtimony to the Doctrine of the Goſpel; it is againſt ſin to prevent the coming in of damnable errors, which would
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61091:74"/> ſink the Souls of people into eternal ruine and deſtruction; he giveth a Teſtimony for the pure Worſhip of God, it is to keep out Superſtition and Idolatry; he giveth a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the Government of Chriſt, this is alſo againſt ſin, againſt thoſe that ſay the Lord ſhall not rule over them or others, but we will rule over you; all our fight, all the reſiſtance that we make is againſt ſin. Now the fight againſt ſin is ſo noble a fight, that every good man ought to reſiſt unto Blood, rather to die than to ſin againſt God, or to ſuffer ſin to prevail in the World; but now when God doth not call us to lay down our Lives, but only to bear a lower Teſtimony, there our obligation riſeth much higher; if God had called us to lay down our Lives, ſhould we not do it? How much more when the Lord only calleth us to give a Teſtimony? St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 6.9. <hi>ſaw them under the Altar, that were ſlain for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that they held.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Conſider, you ſhall overcome by your Teſtimony, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>John</hi> ſaw <hi>the Devil overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony,— Magna eſt veritas,</hi> Truth is a great thing, and it will prevail, look back upon the former Ages of the Church, the Witneſſes which God raiſed up to his Truth in the beginning of the Goſpel were very few; the perſons ſeemed contemptible, yet God overcame the whole World by them, and brought the whole World into ſome profeſſed ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61091:75"/> to the Goſpel of Chriſt, often before the Church had degenerated, many errors prevailed, at laſt <hi>Popery</hi> prevailed; then ſtood up <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> thoſe that look upon that Story would have thought it impoſſible that <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine ſhould have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World; but they overcame by the word of their Teſtimony, and to that Victory they held, doth the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion owe it ſelf: Now this ſhould greatly encourage us not to be aſhamed of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt, it hath ever been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſhall be to the laſt; it is by the Faith and patience of the Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who ſtood cloſe to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, and managed their ſpiritual fight, that the Goſpel hath obtained, and they ought ſtill to hold faſt; for they are ſure of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo long as Chriſt remaineth King in <hi>Sion.</hi> I ſhall add but a few words more, and that is to direct Chriſtians what they ſhould do, that they may not be aſhamed of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Look that you be rooted and grounded in truth;</hi> a Tree that is not well rooted, you know is very eaſily ſhaken, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>If,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you continue in the Faith, grounded and ſettled</hi>— The truth is to make a Chriſtian that he ſhould not be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of the Lord; he had need of a double ground, he had need be <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Faith</hi> according to that Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. And he had need be <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded in love</hi> according to that Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. —<hi>that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61091:75"/> you being rooted and grounded in love,</hi> Col. 2.7. <hi>Rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the Faith</hi> — Chriſtians! look to this, every Witneſs ought to underſtand the cauſe well to which he is to give his teſtimony; many a poor Creature beareth a teſtimony to they know not what, labour to be rooted in the Faith, rooted in love, and rooted in Chriſt; that Soul that is filled with the knowledge of truth, and warmed with the love of truth never faileth in an hour of teſtimony; that Soul that is either ignorant of the ground of that truth which he pretendeth to own and defend, or that wanteth a love for God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver holdeth longer than till he meeteth with a contradiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look up to the power of God for your aſſiſtance, I told you theſe words in the Text, <hi>according to the power of God,</hi> might be taken as an Argument to perſwade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not to be aſhamed of the Teſtimony of the Lord, becauſe the power of the Lord ſhall be manifeſted for them; but they may alſo be interpreted, as ſignifying that which we ought to have an Eye to in our Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and in our ſuffering affliction; we have no ſpiritual enemy we can prevail againſt in our own ſtrength, our enemies you know are the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> for the Fleſh the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. —<hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the Body you ſhall live.</hi> Never yet was luſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by meer moral Arguments, and for the Devil, we are bid to take upon us the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61091:76"/> whole Armour of God, to reſiſt him, ſtrong in the Faith, and it is the ſame for the World; <hi>Our help is in the name of the Lord,</hi> and therefore it hath been obſerved, that none in an hour of Teſtimony have come off worſe than thoſe who have been moſt confident; our Book of Martyrs telleth us of two that were in priſon together, the one was very confident and couragious, and told the other that his fat ſhould fry in the fire next day, the other was very timorous and fearful; the firſt recanted and denied the truth, the ſecond was burnt at the Stake. <hi>David</hi> might poſſibly mean it of his external enemies, but he repeateth it thrice; <hi>My enemies compaſſed me about, but in the name of the Lord I will deſtroy them; they compaſs me about, yea they compaſſed me about, but in the name of the Lord I will deſtroy them; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about like Bees, they are quenched as the fire of Thorns, for in the name of the Lord I will deſtroy them.</hi> It muſt be ſo as to our ſpiritual enemies, we ſhall never prevail, but in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember in your Teſtimony, <hi>There is more with you, than there is againſt you:</hi> While we bear Teſtimony to Chriſt, God is with us, Chriſt is with us, the Spirit is with us, all the Holy Martyrs are with us, there is none but ſinful men againſt us; Chriſt the faithful and true Witneſs is with you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>From Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful Witneſs,</hi> — He was the firſt Witneſs. The Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61091:76"/> are three that bear record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt</hi> —What did the Father witneſs? <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> This is the Lord our righteouſneſs. What did Chriſt witneſs? He witneſſed <hi>a good confeſſion before Pontius Pilate;</hi> he owned himſelf to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the World, that they that believe on him ſhould not be aſhamed; he owned himſelf to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, to be the <hi>Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> the Spirit teſtified the ſame thing, and the Spirit <hi>beareth witneſs for us and in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Would you not be aſhamed of your Teſtimony; <hi>love not the World, nor the things thereof, nor the perſons therein,</hi> take heed of being ſwallowed up in the love of creature comforts and enjoyments: How dwelleth the love of the Father in him that doteth on the World? The World taketh off Chriſts witneſſes, both the Men of the World, and the things of the World, you muſt be fond of none of theſe.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61091:77"/> his Miniſtry, and the Evangeliſt tells us that great multitudes followed him, as you find in the laſt Verſe of the <hi>Chapter:</hi> In this and the Sixth, and Seventh Chapters, he giveth us an account of the <hi>Sermon</hi> he made to this multitude at the foot of the Mountain, a Sermon which containeth many excellent Doctrines. He beginneth it with pronouncing of ſeveral perſons Bleſſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which bleſſedneſſes, theſe two things are to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he pronounceth them quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common vogue and opinion of the world, eſpecially at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the performance of thoſe duties wherein moſt of Chriſtians ſelf-denyal is to be ſhewn, the world bleſſeth <hi>the rich,</hi> he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the poor; as v. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> The world bleſſeth the haughty, he bleſſeth the meek, as <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi> The World bleſſeth thoſe that <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>rejoice,</hi> he bleſſeth thoſe that mourn, as <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> The World bleſſeth them that are <hi>full;</hi> he bleſſeth thoſe that <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The World bleſſeth thoſe that are in Power to oppreſs others, he bleſſeth thoſe that are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,</hi> provided it be for righteouſneſs ſake, as in <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſs, for theirs is the Kingdom of

               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>Revilings of men, perſecution and ſpeaking all manner of evil of them falſly for righteouſneſs ſake, and for Chriſts name ſake, hath always been the portion of the Servants and Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our here doth Propheſie it unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and he ſpeaketh it of his Servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; for ſaith he, <hi>They did ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>Thoſe whoſe lot this falls to are bleſſed; and theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 3. <hi>It is their duty to rejoyce, and be exceeding glad under their perſecution upon theſe conſiderations.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to the Firſt and Second; the two latter will fall in with the <hi>Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Revilings,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking all manner of evil</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> was <hi>always the lot of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> and <hi>of the Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that I have here to open is, 1. <hi>The true notion of perſecution.</hi>

               </p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61091:79"/> with goodneſs, and with holineſs; as it is often taken in Scripture <hi>for Chriſts names ſake,</hi> which is the ſame with for Chriſts ſake, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12. — <hi>Your ſins are forgiven you for his names ſake.</hi> It is the ſame thing which is expreſſed under ſeveral other terms in Scripture, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.18. — <hi>for my ſake</hi> Math. 16.25. — <hi>for my ſake</hi> — Math. 19.12. — <hi>for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake,</hi> — Mark. 4.17. — <hi>for the words ſake</hi> — Luke 6.22. — <hi>for the Son of mans ſake.</hi> In ſhort, it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſuffering which cometh upon us to avoid ſinning againſt the command of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; all ſuch ſuffering is a ſuffering for Jeſus ſake, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heavens ſake, for Chriſts ſake, for the Lords name ſake, for righteouſneſs ſake.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> the Letters were from the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and the <hi>Chief Prieſts of Damaſcus,</hi> the guilt lieth in the act, in the inflicting of puniſhment upon ſuch as ought to be really freed from puniſhment; it is true, he that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he that counſelleth and adviſeth is not excuſed, but much leſs the next immediate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61091:80"/> actor; and this is the moſt reaſonable thing in the World, doth not the Law of man thus deal with offenders: Nay when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the principal agent, it thinketh it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh ſeverely the <hi>inferiour Miniſter;</hi> for were there no Miniſter in wickedneſs, Superiours could do no hurt; and therefore if any be ſo vain as to think they are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they are but <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and do but execute the Will or Sentence of others, they are miſtaken; <hi>Pauls</hi> holding the clothes when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, brought him into the guilt of his death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They are not only perſecuted who reſiſt ſin unto Blood,</hi> and chooſe Death rather than ſin; <hi>but they who are reviled and reproached;</hi> our Saviour you ſee putteth all together; <hi>bleſſed are you, when you are reviled and perſecuted, and when they ſhall ſpeak all manner of evil of you, for my names ſake.</hi> Gal. 4.29. — <hi>He that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit.</hi> If you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtory of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> it is ſaid <hi>Iſhmael</hi> mocked him; thus <hi>Paul</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. — <hi>for thy ſake we are killed all the day long,</hi> — all kind of ſuffering to avoid ſin is perſecution, and thoſe that make them to ſuffer are perſecutors, thoſe that are ſufferers are ſo perſecuted, it is true there are degrees both of this and of other ſins; but he that ſmiteth with the Sword of the Tongue, perſecuteth as well as he that ſmiteth with a Sword that is made of Iron; and he who is ſo ſmitten, is in the Eye of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61091:80"/> God <hi>perſecuted,</hi> as well as he whoſe Life is taken from him: Now I ſay this hath been the lot of the people of God, of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt in all Ages, to ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be purſued by wicked and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, both with their Tongues reviling them, and with their hands endeavouring to do them miſchief, either ſpoiling them of their goods, or depriving them of their lives, and that becauſe they will not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to the ſecond thing; How this doth appear to have been the portion of the people of God?</p>
               <p>It appears by the whole ſtory of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and alſo all Eccleſiaſtical ſtory: Take <hi>Adam's</hi> Family immediately after the fall, <hi>Abel</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Cain,</hi> indeed he did not ſuffer becauſe he would not ſin, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was more righteous, and had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up a better <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> conſider <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, of that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. — <hi>He that was born after the fleſh, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit,</hi> Acts 7.52. <hi>Which of the Prophets have not your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſecuted?</hi> But if you come unto the New Teſtament, and conſider the Church of God in that ſtate, you ſhall find it was perſecuted at all hands: Firſt by the <hi>Jews,</hi> then by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> then by falſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Chriſtians, as is evident in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, in the example of <hi>Stephen</hi> the <hi>Proto-Martyr,</hi> and of Chriſtians ever ſince: Firſt <hi>by the Jews,</hi> of which you read
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61091:81"/> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> then by the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> which perſecution laſted 300 hundred years, till <hi>Conſtantine the Great;</hi> then by <hi>falſe Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and others; thoſe that were <hi>born after the fleſh always perſecuted them who were born after the ſpirit:</hi> It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be worth the while, rather to fathom the bottom of this, to underſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the people of God in all Ages have been the Mark and But of the Worlds envy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The original cauſe muſt be fetched from that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. where God ſaith, <hi>I will put enmity betwixt thee and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed,</hi> — that Text giveth you an account of the reaſon of a three-fold <hi>antipathy</hi> or <hi>enmity</hi> which you find in the World. 1. You ſee there is a <hi>natural antipathy</hi> between the <hi>nature of Man</hi> and a <hi>Serpent,</hi> though we have little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it in <hi>England:</hi> In <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> they are mortal enemies unto Men, and though we have no ſuch exceedingly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Serpents, yet we ſee men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averſe to them, and ſhunning them, and ſeeking to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>antipathy betwixt the Devil and us;</hi> you ſee by daily experience that the Devil is the deſtroyer, though men ſerve him, yet he deſtroyeth them. Witches are the worſt of people, they are his ſlaves, he is their ruine and deſtroyer at laſt; and for the people of God, he is continually moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Here is the reaſon,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:61091:81"/>3. There is an antipathy betwixt the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; who was the Womans ſeed but Jeſus Chriſt? Who are the <hi>ſeed of the Devil</hi> but wicked men? <hi>You are of your Father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>for his works you do:</hi> But although this be the firſt and more remote cauſe, yet there are other proximate and immediate cauſes, and ſome of them I ſhall endeavour to give you an account of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next cauſe, is that <hi>Innate hatred of God, and the Image of God which is in every man ſince the fall,</hi> Rom. 1.30. The Apoſtle telleth us of the Heathen, that they were <hi>backbiters, haters of God</hi> — This is a fruit of the fall, when Man loſt the Image of God in which he was created. No Man hath a natural love for God, or for the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, as they ſay of the <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> that it hath ſuch a hatred to a man, that it will fly upon the Picture of a man, ſo it is true that every Man and Woman by nature are Baſilisks; they fly upon God, and the Image of God where ever they ſee it: Now perſecution is but the <hi>daughter of hatred,</hi> and though every one hath not the like rough and harſh nature, ſo that he is not ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as ſome men are; yet it is moſt certain that no man naturally loveth, yea every man naturally hateth God, and the Image of God, hence the more any one hath of the Image of God upon his Soul, the more he is the object of hatred, and the reaſon of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred lieth in that unlikeneſs that is betwixt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61091:82"/> a man in the ſtate of nature, and a Holy God; a natural man is quite contrary and unlike unto God, our Saviour giveth this very reaſon, <hi>John</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the World hate you, you know that it hated me, before it hated you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third reaſon of it is, <hi>becauſe the works of the people of God do condemn the works of the World.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. Deſcribeth the Heathen as under the notion of ſuch as are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, ſo under the notion of proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; they are proud; the proud man cannot endure to think that any ſhould be better or do better, or be in a better caſe or condition then he is; now there is a light of holineſs by which the Child of God doth outſhine wicked men, and even to rational eyes doth appear more beautiful and comely; as, <hi>John</hi> 7.7. <hi>The world cannot hate you, but me it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil;</hi> Iohn 3.20. <hi>Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved;</hi> John 17.14. —<hi>the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world</hi>—the men of the world have ſo much corruption as will not ſuffer them to be as good as the Diſciples and Servants of God; but they have ſo much <hi>pride,</hi> as will not let them be patient to think them better then themſelves, or that they ſhould be reported better then they; the truth is, every good man is a <hi>Preacher of righteouſneſs,</hi> to a ſinful world, he preacheth by his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they will not endure the Sermons
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61091:82"/> that are made by a good example, any more than that which is made by word of mouth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth <hi>great reaſon of the perſecution of the people of God by the men of the world,</hi> hath been the <hi>liberty they have delighted to take in the things of God, and their ambition to bring all others into a Subjection to their humours in it:</hi> This upon ſearch will be found to have been one of the moſt univerſal cauſes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution at all times; this cauſed the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the three Children, which threw them into the <hi>Fiery Furnace;</hi> this was that which threw <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Den: There was a Law made that no man ſhould pray but only to the King, and <hi>Daniel</hi> could not be tied up to this Law, he is thrown therefore into the <hi>Den of Lions:</hi> This was the cauſe of Chriſt and his Diſciples perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they did not obſerve the <hi>Tradition of the Elders:</hi> The Apoſtles could not abide by the <hi>Decrees,</hi> which commanded them ſtraitly, that they ſhould preach no more in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; this hath been the cauſe of all the <hi>Popiſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> in ſhort, this always hath been, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be a root of violence and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of God; the conſcience of a man in things of God, is a thing that will not, or cannot be controuled by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law; it is matter of Life and Death, of Salvation and Damnation, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an muſt act according to the dictate of his Conſcience, when it doth not ſute with the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61091:83"/> Conſcience of the men of the World, then they fall upon him, and this I ſay hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually been a fountain of blood and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; I come now to the Application.</p>
               <p>Uſe 1. This may let us ſee the favour of God to perſons, whom the Lord hath ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more than others from this bitter Cup: Some particular periods of time there have been, and ſome particular Chriſtians there may be in all times, whom the Lord doth more favour than others; I would have ſuch underſtand that the Lord uſeth them as <hi>Benjamins,</hi> he ſendeth them out a double Meſs; the ordinary portion of thoſe that own the Goſpel is <hi>perſecution,</hi> God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his people no more, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. — <hi>Houſes, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Children, and Lands with perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> — 2 Tim. 3, 12. <hi>All that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.8. Hath the Lord hid thee in the ſtorms and tempeſts, hath he provided for thee, that thou doſt not meet with theſe trials, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Servants of God have met with, thou haſt more abundant cauſe to bleſs the name of the Lord, thou ſeeſt what ſeverity befalls thy Brother, and the goodneſs that attends thee.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. This ſpeaketh unto all the people of God to be <hi>preparing for trials:</hi> And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>To ſtudy their duty under them,</hi> that they may as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>glorifie the Lord</hi> in the Fires; this is a word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore I ſhall take liberty to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61091:83"/> ſpeak more fully to both Branches; and that under theſe two Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What is the duty of the people of God, in reference to Perſecution, not come upon them, or not to that degree, which it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it may come to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What is the duty of the people of God in reference to Perſecution, already come, either upon themſelves, or upon others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Qu. 1. <hi>What ſhould the people of God do in reference to Perſecutions, that are not yet come upon them, or at leaſt not to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which they may expect or fear, or which are come upon other Churches, or people of God.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Live in a dayly expectation of them;</hi> we never worſe encounter any evils then thoſe that ſurprize us; what we live in a dayly view of, uſually when it cometh, doth not take ſo much impreſſion upon our Spirits, as the evils that fall upon us at unawares; 1 Pet. 4.12. <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fiery Tryal</hi>— do not look upon it as a thing that ſhall not come, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much prejudiceth any man, as put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the evil day afar off, and ſaying with <hi>David, I ſhall never be moved,</hi> when God hideth his face in the leaſt, then <hi>we are troubled;</hi> look for a time when your goods ſhall be rifled, when you ſhall be put into Priſon, when you ſhall be brought to die
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61091:84"/> for the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, there is nothing ſo pernicious to you as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is <hi>Job</hi> puts a caſe to himſelf; <hi>if the Lord ſhould kill me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet I will truſt in him;</hi> ſay ſometimes to your ſelves, what ſhould I do if God ſhould ſtrip me naked? If I ſhould be put to wander in <hi>Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins,</hi> be <hi>deſtitute</hi> and <hi>forſaken?</hi> You have all the reaſon in the world to expect this at the world; the world <hi>hateth you,</hi> as much as it hated all the Prophets, all the Servants of God in former Ages, who met with this uſage from it; why ſhould you not expect it, when the Lord hath ſaid, That <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution:</hi> I ſay when the Word hath ſaid, that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution; what reaſon haſt thou to ſay to thy ſelf, I will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, and yet I ſhall not ſuffer perſecution? You have not in this Age yet reſiſted unto blood; but live in an expectation of ſuch a time; that is my firſt counſel to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Above all, <hi>Labour to enſure your peace with God,</hi> and get the beſt evidence for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that you can get; it is the policy of the Princes of the Earth, when they ſee they ſhall certainly have a great War with ſome of their fellow Princes, to make Leagues and Treaties with other Princes, that they may not have them all upon them: I am ſure it is great policy for the poor Flock of God in the world, when they ſee they are
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61091:84"/> like to have a War with the world, to give all diligence to make their Callings and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure; to have a doubt or any fears of the wrath of God, when the wrath of men boileth high againſt Chriſtians is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncomfortable thing; if ever there be a time for men to wreſtle with God in prayer, and to uſe all their endeavours to enſure their intereſt in God; it is a time when the world is moſt likely to quarrel with them, and they are likelieſt to have the ſharpeſt conteſt with men in the world, that ſo they may not have at once two enemies on their Backs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour the mortification of thoſe luſts which may diſturb your Souls in an hour of <hi>perſecution;</hi> it is the policy of all States, and all Nations, when they fear a War, to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that party which when the War comes, they cannot truſt to, and to put them out of all Command at leaſt, if they cannot quite quit them of the place; it will be the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of your Souls, if you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a time of perſecution, to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> if you cannot out them, at leaſt to get them out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in your Souls, eſpecially ſuch luſts as will be moſt ſubject to betray your Souls; you will ſay, what are thoſe luſts? What are thoſe corruptions which are moſt ſubject to betray us in an hour of perſecution; I will inſtance in ſome of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A love of pleaſures;</hi> it is given as the Character of wicked men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. —
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61091:85"/> 
                  <hi>Lovers of pleaſures</hi> — they ſpend their years in pleaſure, <hi>and in a moment go down to the Grave,</hi> Titus 3.3. — <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures:</hi> — Theſe are things that are very grateful to our nature, but he that harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in his boſome, will be very unfit for an hour of <hi>perſecution;</hi> as he ſaid, who ſaw a brave Building, and Gardens, <hi>Theſe are the things that make us unfit for death;</hi> ſo truly we may ſay, theſe are the things that make us unfit for perſecution, they that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfy themſelves without the delight of the Eyes, and without the delight of the Ears, will hardly know how to endure a Priſon, or how to endure affliction, which were not affliction if it were not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of our pleaſures: Study the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your hearts, as to all the pleaſures of this Life, <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.25. <hi>choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Study the mortification of wrath, anger and paſſion;</hi> a time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a time that will anger us, we had not need be Cholerick and Techy in ſuch a time, the want of this is that which maketh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſuffering to <hi>render evil for evil, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for reviling,</hi> and to ſtudy revenge; paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wonderfully roileth the Soul in an evil day, and keepeth it from bearing the Yoke of God with that quietneſs, with which it ought to ſubmit to the good pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61091:85"/>3. A Third Luſt which much prejudiceth us in an hour of perſecution is <hi>Pride,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an high opinion of our ſelves; in ſuch a day as this, God is levelling <hi>high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> God is humbling all the pride of mans glory; take heed of a heart lifted up, and ſwelling high in the opinion of your ſelves, if ever you would endure an hour of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Get your hearts as much mortified to the World as you can. Paul</hi> gloried in the Croſs of Chriſt, by <hi>which the World was Crucified to him, and he Crucified to the World,</hi> Gal. 6.14. All that perſecution can hurt you in, is to divide you from the World, and to imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the World to you; it cannot reach you as to your heavenly concern, as to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt there; ſo that the looſer you ſtand to the World, both as to your inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as to your more outward dealings and trading in it, the fitter you will be for ſuch an hour of trial; what ſignifieth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of him from the World, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dead to the World? When the heart is glued to worldly profits, or worldly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or worldly employments and buſineſs, perſecution maketh a great breach; but where the heart is divided from the World as to all theſe, ſo as it is not fond of any of theſe things, it hath no pleaſure no delight in them, it can live without them, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth little hurt. There is nothing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to the ſtudy of a Chriſtian, as a preparation for perſecution, as the looſening
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61091:86"/> themſelves from <hi>Worldly employments</hi> which are as Nets, and entangle the Soul, and the looſening the Soul from Worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pleaſures and profits, from hearty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the World; this was that which made the Saints of God take the <hi>ſpoiling of their goods with joy;</hi> this is that <hi>hating of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother, Wife and Children,</hi> which our Saviour ſo preſſeth upon his Diſciples, it is a not loving of them more than God; a loving them ſo as we can part with them all, rather than ſin againſt God, and wound our Conſciences.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Take heed of any actions by which you may haſten or aggravate perſecution;</hi> and make it appear more bitter than it is. Though perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution be the lot of the People of God; yet God ſhould chuſe their lot for them, they ought not to carve for themſelves, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are in themſelves evils, and we may pray againſt them, and may uſe means to prevent them, and it is our duty ſo to do; there are two things that may haſten, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and imbitter perſecution to the people of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinnings againſt God.</hi> There is no evil in the City which God hath not done; God uſeth the Sword of Perſecutors to avenge his quarrels, take heed then of ſinning againſt God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Indiſcreet, imprudent converſations towards men.</hi> Take heed of any provocative carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; carry your ſelves as innocently as you will, the World will be angry with you,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61091:86"/> take heed of making them more angry by things which you are not obliged to do, which if done, will diſoblige the Men of the World; there is nothing that more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters our croſſes to us, than the ſour refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Conſciences upon us under them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Live in a daily contemplation of eternity, and a viewing of him who is inviſible;</hi> it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould make us willing to cut off the inch of time which we think may be added to our Lives but the view of eternity; that any thing ſhould make us willing to ſuffer the ſpoiling of our goods with joy, but a knowledge that we have in Heaven a far more enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; that we ſhould ever be willing to part with our dear and ſweet relations, but upon the ſight of better company; if the Heathen upon the contemplation of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul,</hi> could be content to make an end of their Lives, ſurely we may hope, that our contemplation of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are at Gods right hand, ſhould diſpoſe and prepare us for the parting with the pleaſures of ſin which are but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the things which are ſeen, they are temporal (ſaith the Apoſtle) the things which are not ſeen they are eternal. What was that which made <hi>Jacob</hi> endure the cold nights and watchings, but the ſight of <hi>Rachel.</hi> He had a proſpect of a <hi>Rachel;</hi> his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her, was that which he thought would ballance all at laſt. The quicker view of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61091:87"/> any Soul hath, the cheaper all the World will be unto him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Labor for a good ſtock of Faith, Patience and Wiſdom.</hi> The more full aſſent you give to the Propoſition of the Word, and the firmer reliance you have upon the Promiſes, the better you will endure an evil hour; you will eaſily underſtand the reaſon of this, if you conſider that perſecution lieth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but in your being ſtraitned, or ſuffering in things viſible and ſenſible, and faith is the evidence of things not ſeen. I told you before that perſecution only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in ſenſible parts, for elſe indeed they were no afflictions; let me ſhew you the force and power of Faith in this matter to bring a man into a ſtate fitting for perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith ſheweth an inviſible God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſheweth us inviſible things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith ſheweth unto us an inviſible God. There is nothing ſo much emboldneth the Soul to ſin, as our not ſeeing of God; the Fool hath ſaid in his Heart, <hi>There is no God;</hi> no God that hath ſuch an eye to ſee, no God ſo omnipotent, no God ſo ſtrict and ſevere in Juſtice, as he is ſaid to be. Now the more a man ſeeth of an <hi>inviſible God,</hi> the more a man deſpiſeth all viſible ſenſible things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith ſheweth unto the Soul <hi>inviſible things,</hi> and thoſe of an infinite tranſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſupereminent excellency above all things that are viſible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. — <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61091:87"/> into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. — <hi>at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Heb. 11.16. — <hi>a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Country,</hi> Heb. 11.26. — <hi>a recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 10.34. — <hi>a better and enduring ſubſtance.</hi> In all perſecution there are two things; <hi>poena ſenſus, poena damni;</hi> there is a pain of ſenſe, and there is a ſmart, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and in death. Now Faith armeth the Soul, ſhewing him a God more armed to puniſh him in caſe of ſin, than perſecution is armed to make him ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. — <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>but fear him that can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell-fire.</hi> This taketh away all the pain of ſenſe in perſecution; ſenſe tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a man the Perſecutor can do no more than kill the Body, Faith drowns this, by ſhewing the Soul a God that hath the Keys of <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> in his hand, and that can and will <hi>caſt the Soul into Hell fire;</hi> for the pain of ſenſe, it is plain, that Faith devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all that, and for the pain of loſs, it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away that: Is it pleaſure that maketh thee loth to endure perſecution, Faith ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Soul the pleaſures at Chriſts right hand, where are fulneſs of pleaſures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore; is it <hi>profit</hi> that maketh thee loth to endure perſecution? Faith ſheweth the Soul a <hi>more enduring ſubſtance,</hi> a <hi>recompence of reward which</hi> is infinitely above thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61091:88"/> of labour; yea and Faith evidenceth this to the Soul, and giveth the Soul ſuch an evidence of theſe things, that the Soul hath no more doubt, no more fear of theſe things, than if it had theſe other things ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly before its eyes; therefore labour for a ſtock of Faith; when I ſay labour for it, I mean but two things; <hi>ſtudy the promiſes of God, that you may underſtand them, and the compaſs of them; pray to God to make them ſtick to your Souls;</hi> and as this Faith doth it, and hath a great influence upon the Soul to make it valiant in its ſpiritual fight, ſo that Faith which is the reliance of the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath a very great power and influence; for this teacheth the Soul to reſt, and rely upon Chriſt alone for Salvation, and layeth the ſtrongeſt and higheſt obligation imaginable upon the Soul to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and again, to do nothing that may give an offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by diſobedience to any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Endeavour to furniſh your ſelves with patience. Patience is either to be conſidered in the <hi>act,</hi> or in the <hi>habit;</hi> I now ſpeak of the <hi>habit of patience;</hi> a power to exerciſe patience; patience is uſually by Divines ſaid to be <hi>active,</hi> which is a power to wait the good pleaſure of God, for the fulfilling of the promiſe; or <hi>paſſive,</hi> a power quietly to bear the diſpenſation of God to us. Both of them are highly neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:61091:88"/>1. For the firſt, a power to wait for God, for the fulfilling of the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36, 37. <hi>For you have need of patience, that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promiſe: For, yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The ſtaying of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Viſion to an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, and Gods not making haſt in the fulfilling of the promiſe, is that which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the need of this patience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is <hi>a power to bear the good pleaſure of God;</hi> and to ſuffer what is his will. Both theſe are wonderful needful unto a Soul in an hour of perſecution. If you ask me how we ſhall come by patience, the anſwer is eaſie; the <hi>more faith,</hi> the <hi>more patience,</hi> for faith begetteth patience; and becauſe the habits of both are infuſed by God, Prayer is the great means both to obtain theſe and all other influences and habits of grace from God. Endeavour to furniſh your ſelves with the grace and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of patience, patience is the ſuffering grace.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Labour for <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom.</hi> Wiſdom is a practical habit which directeth us to uſe the beſt means, in order to a good end, this wiſdom doth not teach you to deliberate at all about the thing, whether you ſhould ſuffer or no, but only concerning the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of the thing; to do it in the beſt manner, is as God ſhall have moſt honour, and your own Souls moſt peace and comfort. You know our Saviour
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61091:89"/> ſaith, <hi>be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> to his Exhortation to patience preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjoineth this of wiſdom; <hi>If any of you want wiſdom, let him ask it of God;</hi> there is a great wiſdom to be uſed in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>And if a man alſo ſtrive for maſteries, yet is he not Crowned, except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi> To this of the Apoſtle is ſubjoined, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou therefore endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This point of wiſdom to be uſed in ſuffering is a large point, and I cannot ſpeak ſo much to it as I ſhould; I ſhall only here ſay that it lieth very much in avoiding needleſs provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of our adverſaries, either by word or deed; they will be angry do we what we can, but certainly it is the wiſdom of a Chriſtian to avoid needleſs provocations, by ſuffering as patiently, as meekly, and calmly as we are able.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Would you prepare for an hour of perſecution? <hi>walk cloſe with God.</hi> Walking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and cloſely with God, is the duty of a Chriſtian at all times, both with reference to his eternal Salvation, and in reference to his peace, but never more needful than at ſuch a time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. You ſhall find this paſſage; <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing. Iſrael</hi> was not only concerned to take heed of wickedneſs at all times, but eſpecially then, for fear of provoking God, when the Lords Sword is drawn; <hi>when the Lion roareth, the Beaſts of the Forreſt tremble;</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61091:89"/> when a man entreth into perſecution, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out to Battel; this is our Battel with the world: We do at all times ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take heed of ſin, but more at ſuch a time than at another: Our Lord ſpeaking of his coming, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom when his Maſter cometh, he ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> When the Lord letteth looſe the men of the world, to execute their rage againſt the people of God, the Lord doth come in a way of wrath and anger againſt his own people; you had need at ſuch a time take heed to your ſelves; every one girdeth his Rayment cloſe to him in a time of Winter, and pulleth his Cloak cloſe about him in a ſtorm; though a Chriſtian ſtandeth obliged at all times to walk cloſe with God, yet if ever he may give himſelf a liberty and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to a garment of holineſs, certainly it ſhould not be in the Winter, it ſhould not be when a ſtorm is coming.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be much in Prayer. As we do nothing in our own ſtrength, ſo do we much leſs ſuffer in our own ſtrength, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>For unto you it is given on the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> It is a gift, and it muſt be given to us of God for to ſuffer; all gifts we have from God are obtained by asking; the Lord giveth his holy Spirit unto them that ask it, and reaſon teacheth us to double our Petitions, and to double our fervour and heat in petitioning, when the mercy we ask is more neceſſary for us, or at ſuch a time
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61091:90"/> when we ſtand in a more ſpecial and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular need of that mercy which we go to God for; our Lord hath taught us this by his example: He went and prayed, and thrice repeated the ſame words, that is, the ſame matter of prayer: I ſay by that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple our Lord hath ſhewed us what is our great duty in ſuch a time to pray to God, either that the Cup may paſs from us, or that he would furniſh us with grace and ſtrength to glorify God in the fire; thus much for the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is the duty of Chriſtians, when the hour of perſecution is come upon them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here in the firſt place is a caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be ſpoken to about <hi>flight; Whether it be lawful for Chriſtians to fly in a time of perſecution to avoid the ſtorm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have been very different opinions of Divines, ſome have aſſerted it <hi>utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to fly;</hi> others moderate it, and ſay, <hi>That before a Chriſtian is taken, he may fly,</hi> but <hi>if he be taken, they think he ought to ſtand to it,</hi> and not to fly; others have affirmed it, <hi>as a duty to fly:</hi> I do not think the caſe is to be ſpoken to in the general, becauſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will much alter this caſe, as to flight, or voluntary withdrawing our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is lawful for a Chriſtian to fly, when the cauſe of God cannot be advantaged by his ſtay, but may be prejudiced;</hi> and when parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ties do not oblige him for to ſtay; our Saviour bids his Diſciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61091:90"/> 
                  <hi>When they perſecute you in this City, flee you into another:</hi> I know ſome ſay, that this was only a permiſſion of a duty enjoined the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord, to the intent the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may be Preached, but there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of this, that ſelf-preſervation is a duty that we owe to our ſelves, and the very Law of Nature obligeth to it, when ſome particular law of God doth not countermand the law of nature; ſo long as there is any probable hope that the cauſe of God may be advantaged by our ſtay, that a man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a ſtake in a Hedg, take it out and the Hedge falleth, he muſt not ſtir; but when the caſe is ſo, as a mans ſtay can no way further the intereſt of God, he may lawfully withdraw; it is a rule in War, when the Field is loſt, no Captain doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of providing for himſelf; ſo though a man be a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and of great uſe in a place, yet when he ſeeth the Church is diſperſed, and he can do no good by his ſtay, there is no queſtion but in this caſe he may fly and ſecure himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is yielded on all hands, <hi>That when the perſecution is perſonal, it is lawful for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to avoid the dint of it;</hi> when a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſter is aimed at, or a particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and there be others; who (if he be gone) may do his work, and bear up the cauſe of God; I ſay in this caſe, it hath been granted to be the duty of perſons to fly in a time of perſecution; in ſhort, I take it to be the duty of Chriſtians in ſuch caſes to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61091:91"/> withdraw, when they can do it without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God, the flight barely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is no ſin, if no other ſin attendeth it. If a man hath boaſted of his ſtanding and then fly, if a man cannot ſtir, but he muſt betray the intereſt of God in the place where he is, or fail in his diſcharge of his duty to them whom the Lord hath ſet him in near Relation to, he may ſin. But in the general when a man can withdraw, and by his withdrawing not run into a neglect of any other duty by which he is tied to glorify God, or to do good to the Souls of others, I believe it to be ſo far from the duty of a Chriſtian not to fly, as it is his duty to fly; I conclude therefore:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, It is the duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in a time of perſecution to ſtand to it, to endure it until the Lord openeth ſome door by which they may go out without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God; either deſerting the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his honour and glory, or their own duty to them to whom the Lord hath ſet them in near Relation: We may fly if God openeth us a door, but we muſt not break our ſelves a Gap, we muſt ſee God going before us, and guiding of us, as to what we do; this is to be a good Soldier of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is doubtleſs the great duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſuch a time, <hi>to live as winning and obliging a converſation as poſſibly we can,</hi> that we may not by any Indiſcretion pull down any ſuffering or trial upon our ſelves. We
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61091:91"/> ought always to remember we are Factors for God, and to walk ſo as to win others, but eſpecially at ſuch times, when the worlds paſſions are in a great fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is unqueſtionably a great duty of Chriſtians in a time of perſecution, to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a charitable frame of ſpirit, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> You ſee this in the practice of our Saviour; <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do:</hi> And <hi>Stephen</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was dying, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin unto their charge;</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>For hereunto were you called; becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that you ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> Our hearts are very prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and the more cauſeleſly we ſuffer from any, the more our anger riſeth, and the more we are prone to ſtudy revenge, therefore the mortification of anger in the checking of our paſſion, is highly neceſſary to us in ſuch an hour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We ought not to be ſolicitous either what to ſay, or what to do.</hi> Be you only careful of your duty, that you do not bring your ſelves into trials, that you do not ſuffer as evil-doers, either with reſpect to the cauſe for which you ſuffer, or to any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relating to it; ſee that you ſtrive, and ſtrive lawfully, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.11. <hi>When they ſhall lead you and deliver you up, take no thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61091:92"/> what you ſhall ſpeak; neither do you preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, but whatſoever ſhall be given you in that hour, that ſpeak you, for it is not you that ſpeak but the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> You may be aſſured that God never calleth you to any work, but he will ſtand by you; you know who was in the fiery Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22. <hi>My God hath ſent his Angels,</hi> ſaith Daniel, <hi>and hath ſhut the Lions mouths, that they have not hurt me,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16. <hi>At my firſt anſwer no man ſtood with me, but all men forſook me,</hi> v. 17. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord ſtood with me, and ſtrengthened me.</hi> You have heard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Martyrs burning at the ſtake, they felt no more pain than if they were in a Bed of Roſes; ſtudy nothing more than how you may be able to glorify God in the fires.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then if ever it is your duty not to be ſeeking great things for your ſelves in this life, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? ſeek them not</hi> — A Chriſtian ſhould order his Converſation in Conformity to Gods diſpenſation; he ſhould not be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing himſelf with Ornaments, when God is ſtripping of him; he ſhould not then be furniſhing his houſe with fine things, when Gods providence is ſtripping of him naked; he ſhould not then be perfuming himſelf with ſweet ſmells, when the Lord is ſending him a ſtench and rents.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then, if ever, a Chriſtian ſtands moſt highly concerned to fill his thoughts with ſpiritual objects, to be thinking of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61091:92"/> at Gods right hand, thinking of that ſubſtance that ſhall endure, of that better Country, which God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. <hi>A Chriſtian ought in an hour of trial, to be ready to give a reaſon of the hope that is in him, to every one th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

It is mixed with the Apoſtles directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Chriſtians, how to behave themſelves under <hi>perſecution,</hi> a Chriſtian is not bound to bring himſelf into trouble; but if the Lord hath ſpread his Net over him that he cannot eſcape; if the Lord hath hedged up his way with Thorns, he ought to be ready to give an account of his Faith, and of his hope to them that ask him: <hi>Peter</hi> failed in this, who denied that he knew the man of whom the Maid ſpake; but I pray obſerve, there is a difference to be put betwixt a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Faith,</hi> and a Confeſſion of a Fact; I do not think that in a matter of Fact a Chriſtian is bound to betray himſelf: When <hi>Pilate</hi> asked our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.11. <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews? Jeſus ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Thou ſayeſt.</hi> But this is not all, we are not only to be ready to give a reaſon of our Faith, or of our hope, but we muſt do it with <hi>meekneſs and with fear,</hi> in an humble manner, with that due reverence which is due unto thoſe, whom the Lord hath ſet in a ſtation above us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We are not to be aſhamed of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of his words,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61091:93"/> 
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful generation of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with his holy Angels.</hi> Luke 12.8. — <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man alſo c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſeſs before the Angels of God.</hi> And you may find the ſame thing, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.32. The Apoſtle obſerveth of our Lord, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>That he before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion.</hi> Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he adjureth <hi>Timothy,</hi> that according to his example he alſo ſhould fight the good fight, and keep the Faith. Here ariſeth a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is to be determined in this caſe, when the Magiſtrate commandeth that which he ought to command; or which at leaſt he thinketh he may command, and the Chriſtian doth not obey, becauſe he thinketh that in obeying he ſhould ſin againſt God; whether in this caſe is the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Act</hi> Perſecution, <hi>and the Inferiour perſecuted yea or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, it unqueſtionably dependeth not upon the Judgment of men, whether the thing commanded be lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that iſſue muſt be determined by God; for God alone is Judge of truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of what is lawful or unlawful; and ſuch purſuits muſt be determined at the Bar of God, whether they be perſecution or not.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:61091:93"/>2. It is moſt certain, <hi>men may perſecute others for righteouſneſs ſake, and yet think they do that which they ought to do,</hi> Acts 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>Whoſoever killeth you will think he doth God ſervice.</hi> And it is as certain, men may think they ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, when they ſuffer for their iniquity as evil doers, as Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Superiour thinketh himſelf bound to do it, he muſt do it;</hi> and where the other thinketh he is bound to ſuffer, he ought to ſuffer; yet the one may be puniſhed for doing, the other may be rewarded for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the Magiſtrate is not bound, but only uſeth his liberty, though he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Subject be bound to obey, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how the action ſhall be excuſed from perſecution, the reaſon is, the Superiour may forbear his command, the Inferiour cannot avoid his ſuffering; this is in ſhort, what I think of this caſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds,</hi> Heb. 13.2. <hi>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them.</hi> You ſhould remember them in your prayers, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5. Peter <hi>was kept in priſon, prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church unto God for him.</hi> Rom. 15.30.— <hi>Strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me.</hi> Remember them in your <hi>viſits.</hi> Mat 25.36. —<hi>I was ſick, and you viſited me.</hi> Remember
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61091:94"/> them with your <hi>purſes.</hi> In the Primitive Church Chriſtians upon this account had all things common, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34. <hi>For as many as were poſſeſſors of lands, or houſes, ſold them, and brought the prices of the things which were ſold.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.14. <hi>That now at this time your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance may be a ſupply for their want.</hi> Phil. 4.15. <hi>No Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.</hi> There is yet one piece of duty behind, and that our Saviour here hinteth; <hi>Rejoyce and be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad.</hi> Here are three things I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will open the words to you, and ſhew you the import of them, what this is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> and be exceeding glad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will anſwer the Queſtion, <hi>how we can rejoyce and be exceeding glad?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I will ſhew you <hi>the ground upon which a Chriſtian ſhould be exceeding glad. Rejoyce,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and be exceeding glad.</hi> Joy is nothing but the ſatisfaction of the Soul in the union that it hath with ſome good thing that is preſent, ſo as it muſt neceſſarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Negatively,</hi> 1. <hi>A ſatisfaction of mind in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to grief, and trouble, and affliction.</hi> Grief is the true oppoſite to Joy; when we are bid to rejoyce, we are bid not to grieve; for no man can rejoyce and grieve heartily in a breath; perſecution is not a thing fit for a Chriſtians tears. Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fit for a Chriſtians tears but only ſin; and ſo far there may be matter of grief for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61091:94"/> us under a perſecution, if it hath been brought upon us by our ſins, or by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion; but take it as it is a ſuffering for <hi>the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is not. He ſlurs the Crown of Martyrdom that droppeth a tear, or ſpendeth a ſigh upon it: Let men howl and weep that are ſent to Gaol, and brought to the Gallows for the ſatisfaction of their luſts; but let them take heed of grieving, that are only ſent to priſon, or brought to a ſtake, for the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſatisfaction of mind in oppoſition to diſcontent, murmuring or repining;</hi> for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grief, which is directly oppoſite to our joy, will ſpoil our mirth, but even a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and diſſatisfaction will ſpoil our joy; for joy requireth the ſatisfaction of the mind, ſo as it muſt be at reſt, and not toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down with the waves of many fears and cares. Chriſtians ſhould not be diſcontented at God's diſpenſations; they ſhould not grudge, nor murmure, nor repine at God, if he ſhall pleaſe to bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a diſpenſation as to ſuffer for his Name ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implieth a ſatisfaction of mind, in oppoſition to ſollicitude; as he whoſe heart is full of grief, or whoſe heart is full of diſcontent, cannot rejoyce: So he whoſe heart is full of carefulneſs, cannot rejoyce neither. This is that which our Lord cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth his Diſciples againſt, <hi>Take no thought of what you ſhall ſay;</hi> and this is the reaſon that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61091:95"/> in thoſe fierce and furious times, the Apoſtle did ſo caution Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32. <hi>I would have you be without carefulneſs,</hi> Phil. 4.6. <hi>Be careful in nothing,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> So then, when our Lord calleth unto his Diſciples to rejoyce, and to be exceeding glad, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth them immoderate grief, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining at God's diſpenſations; and he forbiddeth them ſollicitous and anxious care, either what they ſhould ſay, or how they ſhould bear the Croſs that the Lord bringeth them under.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Secondly, There is ſomething <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and this our Saviour doth hint to us by the two words that he uſeth in this place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the latter word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a great exceſs of joy, which doth not keep within the bounds of the heart, but breaketh forth in actions. Divines have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it anſwereth an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, which ſignifieth dancing joyfully, and is uſed of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.29. dancing before the Ark; and this agreeth with <hi>James</hi> 1.2. <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;</hi> where temptations ſignifieth <hi>perſecutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the preſence of the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name.</hi> It is the duty of Chriſtians not only not to grieve and be troubled, not only not to be diſcontented, and to murmure and repine; not only to be free from ſollicitude and trouble of ſpirit becauſe of perſecution,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61091:95"/> but on the contrary, to rejoyce and to be glad, yea and that with the greateſt exceſs of joy, to leap for joy.</p>
               <p>Obj. But will ſome Chriſtians ſay, <hi>How ſhould a Chriſtian do this? Can a man rejoyce in evil? Is it not contrary to the very nature of man to rejoyce in an evil? Is it not contrary to whatſoever is the duty of a Chriſtian, to rejoyce in the afflicting hand of God upon him? How then ſhall a man be glad and rejoyce in perſecution, and either anſwer the Law of Nature, or the Will and Pleaſure of God, not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his diſpenſations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, It is one thing to rejoyce in the affliction, and another thing to rejoyce in the time of the affliction; it is one thing to rejoyce when we are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and another thing to rejoyce becauſe we are <hi>perſecuted.</hi> God doth not require that of you which is contrary to your Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; God requireth of no man to rejoyce becauſe he ſuffereth, but yet he may rejoyce <hi>when he is perſecuted;</hi> he may rejoyce that he is thought worthy to ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is one thing to rejoyce in the ſmart of a perſecution, another thing to rejoyce in the cauſe of a ſuffering, and the fruit and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſuffering. God doth not require of any perſon to rejoyce in the ſmart of an evil, but only in the cauſe, and in the fruit of it, which I ſhall open further to you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one thing for a Chriſtian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in perſecution, as it is a token of God's
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61091:96"/> anger and diſpleaſure, another thing for to rejoyce in it, as a means by which it pleaſeth God to make the Soul of his Saints perfect unto glory. The Apoſtle tells us, that no affliction is joyous at preſent, but grievous.</p>
               <p>3 Obj. The laſt Queſtion which remains is, <hi>What ground of ſolid joy and rejoycing hath a Chriſtian under perſecution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall open this to you in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I begin with thoſe of the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe the Lord hath bleſſed them.</hi> This is matter of joy. Is it not matter of joy to a Chriſtian, that he is in ſuch a condition as he is under a bleſſing; yea not under a ſingle bleſſing, but under a treble bleſſing? Is it nothing to you, Sirs, to be bleſſed of God, to have him who knoweth the ſtate of every Soul, in whoſe hand are all bleſſings, and curſings, and whom he bleſſeth they ſhall be bleſſed, and whom he curſeth they ſhall be curſed? Is it nothing for you to be in ſuch a ſtate, that you are ſure you are under the bleſſing of God, that you are ſome of thoſe he hath pronounced bleſſed, thrice over bleſſed, though you be here ſome of them who are hated, reviled and perſecuted, and ſpoken evil of falſly for the Lords Name ſake?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Yours is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> You have a phraſe very like this, which will come into conſideration; <hi>Great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Heaven.</hi> I ſhall not at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in that ſenſe. Our Saviour ſaith elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:61091:96"/> The Kingdom of Heaven within us is the Throne of Chriſt ſet up in our hearts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>The Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth upon you.</hi> So this ſhall be an evidence unto you, that the <hi>Kingdom of God is ſet up in your hearts.</hi> Thus the words of our Saviour are made good; <hi>It ſhall be unto you for a teſtimony.</hi> The Kingdom of Chriſt is then ſet up in any Soul, when Chriſt ruleth, and other things truckle under him and his Law; when a Chriſtian overcometh in a good fight; when he is too hard for the World, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flatter him into a diſobedience to Chriſt, nor frown him into a diſobedience of Chriſt, it is a ſign that Chriſt ſitteth as Lord and as King in that Soul, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is within that man; it is a teſtimony of grace, and that the Spirit of God reſteth upon that man, and the Spirit of Glory reſteth on that man. <hi>On your part</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) he is glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> The Papiſts make a great ſtir about the term of a reward, as if it muſt needs be a correlative to a work; but as there is a reward of debt, (as you reward a man that hath laboured for you, and done you ſome valuable ſervice) ſo there is alſo a reward of grace. The <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaith to the Child, if you will do ſuch a thing, I will give you a new Coat; here is a reward given upon the Child's obedience; but yet the Child's obedience doth not earn it. There is a reward of grace, as well as a reward of debt; there is a reward of a work,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61091:97"/> which is not always a juſt reward for a work; life everlaſting is promiſed as the reward of them that ſuffer perſecution; <hi>But our afflictions are,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but light and momentany afflictions,</hi> though they work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, <hi>James</hi> 1.12. Is not this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of rejoycing, that the reward of a man is great in Heaven? 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. It is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you <hi>of reſt with us, when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall be revealed.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. They perſecuted the Prophets that were before you. There is a great cauſe of rejoycing in this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no new thing to you; it is but what hath been the Lot of the people of God formerly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is no new thing to men, ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly not to the moſt eminent Servants of God. Such were the Prophets; nay, the more eminent they were in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more they have been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Rod.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This adminiſtreth further comfort to Chriſtians in ſuffering, that thoſe who have profeſſed to the ſame Religion, yet have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted thoſe born after the Spirit. The Jews owned the ſame God, and the ſame Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the <hi>Prophets</hi> did, yet they perſecuted the Prophets. Laſtly,</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſpeaketh you the <hi>true Members of the Church.</hi> You partake of the common affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Members of it; that our Lord might let them know, that it was no new
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61091:97"/> thing, he ſaith, <hi>They perſecuted the Prophets which were before you,</hi> that our Lord might let them know they were not too good for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, he ſays, <hi>So perſecuted they the Prophets,</hi> who yet were the beſt of the Servants of God, leſt it ſhould be a trouble to them, that perſons owning the ſame Religion, were their Enemies; he ſaith, <hi>So perſecuted they the Prophets,</hi> that he might ſhew them with whom they had communion in their ſufferings, namely, with the Antient Church of God, he ſaith, <hi>For ſo perſecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I muſt yet riſe one note higher; you are partakers of the afflictions of Jeſus Chriſt; this is a ground of rejoycing; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. <hi>in as much as you are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, you may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> Phil. 1.20. <hi>Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body,</hi> Col. 1.24. <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind, of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh.</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>deſired to know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his Death.

               </p>
               <p>Thus far I have diſcourſed the duty of God s people relating to an hour of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether imminent, or already come
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61091:98"/> upon them; but in all perſecution, there muſt be an Agent as well as a Patient.</p>
               <p>Laſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Muſt this be the Lot of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, of all thoſe that will live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus, to ſuffer perſecution, <hi>take heed your hand be not upon them. Offences muſt come,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>but woe unto him through whom they come: It were better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were caſt into the Sea.</hi> The will of God concerning an event, will not juſtifie the proximate cauſe or agent in an action; undoubtedly of all ſins, there is no ſin that is greater in its kind than this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider with your ſelves, by way of compariſon, if it be a great ſin for a man to do hurt to thoſe that are <hi>innocent,</hi> how much greater muſt it be to do evil to one, becauſe he doth good? God hath taken a particular charge of innocent perſons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>The innocent and righteous perſon ſtay thou not,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.25. <hi>Curſed be he that taketh reward to ſlay an innocent perſon,</hi> Job 22.30. <hi>He ſhall deliver the Iſland of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> Now I ſay, if that ſtealing from a man that hath done me no harm, or the taking away his goods by violence, or oppreſſing him be ſuch a guilt in the ſight of God, judge how great the ſin muſt be to ſlay a righteous perſon, to undo, or do injury to a perſon meerly becauſe he doth that which is good, and dare not ſin againſt the Lord his God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would have you conſider how much the Lord intereſteth himſelf in the quarrels
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61091:98"/> of his people, and in their injuries; <hi>He that toucheth you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>toucheth the Apple of my Eye.</hi> The Lord counteth his people as <hi>the Apple of his Eye,</hi> as his <hi>Jewels.</hi> Now for you to plunder the Lord's Iewels, for you to venture to touch the <hi>Apple of God's Eye,</hi> judge what the iſſue ſhall be. When <hi>Saul</hi> was breathing out threatning, and bringing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution upon the Church of God, the Lord called unto him out of Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> And when he ſaid, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> the Anſwer was, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi> And if the Lord doth ſo ſeverely take notice of the omiſſions of doing good to his people, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. Pronouncing the Sentence, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Verſe 42. <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink:</hi> Verſe 43. <hi>I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; ſick and in priſon, and ye vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited me not.</hi> What do you think the Lord will do to them that take their bread from them, and their garments from them, and are Inſtruments to throw them into priſon?</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would have you conſider what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vengeance hath followed them who have been Inſtruments in perſecution in all times. You know how the Lord puniſhed <hi>Cain,</hi> ſo as he cryed out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I am able to bear.</hi> You know how the Lord puniſhed <hi>Iſhmael, Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh Nation.</hi> In ſhort, this work of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61091:99"/> perſecution hath been the ruine of all thoſe that have ever medled with it; Chriſt, that ſtone which the builders refuſed, hath faln upon them, and ground them to powder, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.18. Precious in the ſight of God is the blood of his Saints; he will requite it. If the blood of a Man ſlain, doth ſo defile a Land,<note place="margin">Numb. 35.33.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Land ſhall not be purged but by the blood of him that ſhed it;</hi> what do you think will the precious blood of the Saints do? What therefore <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Wife ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in her meſſage, <hi>Have thou nothing to do with that righteous perſon:</hi> So I ſay, have nothing to do with men that only ſtrive againſt ſin, and put themſelves upon ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this extremity, rather than they will ſin againſt God; let others meddle at their perils, but have you nothing to do with them. Take heed of all perſecution; and that you may know what you are to avoid, let me deſire you to compare this Text with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.22. <hi>Bleſſed are you, when men hate you, and when they ſhall ſeparate you from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſhall reproach you, and caſt out your name as evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The root of perſecution is hatred;</hi> and he that hateth a man, becauſe he doth not ſin, perſecuteth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>hatred</hi> is <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from them,</hi> from their company; let thoſe that have to do with perſecution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is <hi>caſting out their name,</hi> reproaching, reviling, ſpeaking evil of them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61091:99"/>4. Another thing in that which is ſet out under the notion of perſecution, reacheth to <hi>the ſpoiling them of their goods, of their liberty, and of their lives.</hi> Take heed of it, if God maketh it their lot, yet be you not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in ſetting out their lot to them. <hi>Executioners</hi> of Juſtice are neceſſary in a State, yet the Imployment, we ſee, is what none is ambitious of. <hi>Offences muſt come.</hi> There muſt be ſome to perſecute, but <hi>woe be to thoſe by whom they come.</hi> Perſecutors are but the Executioners of Divine Decrees and Juſtice, but they mean not ſo. God will reckon with them, not for executing his will, but for executing their own luſts of malice and rage. Not many of them die the deaths of other men.</p>

               <p>MY Text is made up of Riddles, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but no real contradictions, where ſeveral things ſeem firſt to be ſaid, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, concerning the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe lives, (as the lives of many good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians)
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61091:100"/> are ſtill made up of things hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to carnal men, who know of no <hi>diſtreſſes,</hi> but what are from without, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but that whoſe object is ſome muddy earthly good, no forſaking but that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, no deſtroying but that of the fleſh, but yet intelligible enough to thoſe who have taſted how good the Lord is, and who have ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt good and evil. What is ſaid here, hath been true, and is at this day true of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, beſides thoſe of whom the Text pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily ſpeaks, for that ſpeaketh only of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, but it concerns us, upon whom the fagg-end of the World is come, and who live in the latter part of the laſt days. For whatſoever things were written before, were written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. The things that have been are, and ſhall be, and there is nothing new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun. There is no temptation hath befallen you (ſaith the Apoſtle) but what is common to men.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> is thought to have been written ſoon after his firſt Epiſtle to them from <hi>Philippi,</hi> one of the firſt Cities upon the Coaſt of <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 16.12. Thither <hi>Paul</hi> went, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.1, 2. when he departed from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> after the uproar made at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, ch.</hi> 19. by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> for fear that by the Goſpel coming amongſt them, he ſhould
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61091:100"/> loſe his Trade of making Silver-ſhrines for <hi>Diana.</hi> The occaſion of the writing of it to thoſe that read it, will appear to be to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf from the calumnies and aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which falſe Teachers had caſt upon him, who charged him with <hi>levity, pride, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> rendred his perſon contemptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo to acknowledge to them their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in contribution to the Saints, their kind reception of <hi>Titus,</hi> and the good effect his former Epiſtle had. In this and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going chapter he <hi>magnifieth his Office,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to thoſe who had vilified him, as from other things, ſo from the ſcandal of the Croſs under which he was. You have in the Text,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul's external ſtate and condition,</hi> or his outward deformity and miſery; he was <hi>troubled, perplexed, perſecuted, caſt down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His inward beauty, ſupport</hi> and <hi>conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Not diſtreſſed, not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, not forſaken, not deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence two Propoſitions are obviouſly the Propoſitions of Truth contain'd in this Text.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>The beſt of God's people may be troubled on every ſide, perplexed, perſecuted, caſt down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>It is their peculiar priviledge, that when they are troubled, they are not diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; when they are perplexed, they are not in deſpair; when they are perſecuted, they ſhall not be forſaken; when they are caſt down, they ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61091:101"/>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the firſt Propoſition is no more than this; That there is no kind, no degree of trouble, to which the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants of God are not in this life ſubjected and expoſed. Here are four words in the Text, the ſignification of which this great Apoſtle of the Gentiles applieth to himſelf, the other Apoſtles, and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians of his Age, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All trouble you know is either <hi>External,</hi> or <hi>Internal,</hi> either from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of God, or from the juſt hand of God; mediately by the wicked hands of men, or from our ſelves (for we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our own tormentors.) Theſe words are expreſſive of all theſe kinds of trouble. Let me a little open theſe terms to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we tranſlate it, troubled on every ſide. In the <hi>Greek</hi> it is, <hi>In all,</hi> or every (ſuppoſe) place, or kind, or thing in every circumſtance of our lives. The word is uſed generally, to ſignifie any kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that preſſeth a man, and ſo uſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. In the World you ſhall have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>trouble:</hi> We meet with more than one kind of trouble in the World, derived either from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a word ſignifying to <hi>break,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth to wear, becauſe trouble and affliction either breaks us in our body, or bodily comforts, or in our ſpirits, and weareth us; it ſignifieth to pinch us (as a ſhoe pincheth our foot.) The way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſtrait way,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61091:101"/> which men muſt crowd hard to get thorow. God's people are preſſed, ſtraitned, pinched, (or as this verſe is) troubled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, on every ſide, in every place, upon all turns, in all the circumſtances of their lives, the World would be rid of them, and God would wean them from the World; God therefore by his providence maketh every place, every circumſtance of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to them, and ſuffereth the World to break them, and wear them up as faſt as may be. God is haſtening the time when he will rain Fire and Brimſtone on <hi>Sodom,</hi> and he cannot do it till his <hi>Lot</hi> be out: He is therefore by daily providences, calling away his <hi>Lots,</hi> that he may be let alone whiles he executeth Vengeance on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the utmoſt, and not be kept off by their Importunities for one year longer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next word by which the Apoſtle expreſſeth their ſtate is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifies to doubt and be in ſuſpence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20. <hi>John</hi> 13.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.20. It is a word that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a trouble through an uncertainty of mind, which may not only reſpect Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Truth, or Promiſes, but Iſſues of Providence, which is an incertainty which Gods people are, and may be at; for <hi>who knoweth what a day may bring forth?</hi> The complexion of providence may be ſo low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (to humane ſenſe) upon the Church of God, that the beſt and wiſeſt of them may be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, at an incertainty of mind, not able to determine what God will be pleaſed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61091:102"/> to do either with themſelves or with his people (the generality of them) in ſuch or ſuch a Precinct; for though the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, or all individual Believers, yet they may prevail againſt a particular Church, or ſome particular Members of it, ſo as the wiſeſt men, having no ſure word of Prophecy, or Promiſe to caſt Anchor upon, may be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in a great doubt what God will do with them, or the Church to which they relate. <hi>Criticks</hi> derive the word from the privative particle, α, which is as much as not, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>tranſitus,</hi> according to which notion it ſignifies <hi>without a paſſage.</hi> To be in trouble, and to have, and ſee no way out, in ſuch a condition as the Lepers were when the Famine prevailed in <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.4. If they ſtay'd there, they ſaw they muſt ſtarve, if they went into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they muſt die there, if they went to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army, it was a venture whether they would not kill them. Theſe men were now <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, perplexed, and the beſt of men may be in ſuch a condition as to outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In this caſe <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.23. his <hi>way was hid,</hi> God had <hi>hedged him in.</hi> The Church was in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.7. <hi>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out.</hi> Though indeed theſe outward ſtreſſes of providence, are not ſo properly the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the doubtfulneſs, anxiety, and ſuſpence of mind upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third word by which the Apoſtle
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61091:102"/> expreſſeth their ſtate is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a word both frequently and variouſly uſed in the New Teſtament; as it is applied to <hi>things</hi> or perſons, it properly ſignifies an hot, eager, and violent purſuit of a perſon or thing, and the humane action expreſſed by it is good or bad, according to the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the thing or perſon proſecuted, or the cauſe of the proſecution. It is generally (in the New Teſtament, when it is applied to perſons) uſed to ſignifie the eager and conſtant proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of perſons for Chriſts ſake, or for righteouſneſs ſake. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 44. <hi>ch.</hi> 10.23. And thus (ſome obſerve) that being applied to perſons it always doth ſignifie in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt word by which their ſtate is expreſt, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth <hi>thrown,</hi> or <hi>caſt down;</hi> it doth not ſignifie ſuch a <hi>caſting down,</hi> as a man ſometimes afflicteth himſelf with, by a demiſſion of his ſpirits, and failing in his courage; ſuch a caſting down as is mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.14.62.4. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and the Primitive Chriſtians were <hi>caſt down</hi> by the tongues &amp; hands too of wicked men, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch a caſting down as the Devil is ſaid to be caſt down by, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10. Where the very ſame word is uſed that is uſed here.</p>
               <p>So then, the ſenſe of the Propoſition is this, That the beſt of God's people may be broken in pieces, worn with afflictions, in ſuch circumſtances, as may cauſe them, as to their external concerns, to be in great doubt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61091:103"/> what to do, great perplexity and ſuſpence, violently, and inceſſantly purſued by wicked men, who may overtake them, and caſt them down from their dignity and excellency. I ſhall not ſtay upon the proof of this, which needeth none to thoſe that are but meanly acquainted with the Story of Scripture, and reflect upon the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph, Jacob,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites in Egypt, David, Chriſt, the Apoſtles.</hi> Nor ſhall I offer at any Reaſons of it. The ſweetneſs lies in the next Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>That though they be troubled on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, yet they ſhall not be diſtreſſed; tho' they be perplexed, they ſhall not be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; tho' they be perſecuted, they ſhall not be forſaken; tho' they be caſt down, they ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here now are four words anſwering the former four; four good words anſwering the four former evil words; four words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their relief and grounds of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other four expreſſed their miſery and afflictions; let us examine alſo the import of them; and 2dly, ſee how theſe Predicates agree with the aforementioned Subjects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifieth to be ſtraitned in place, as a man who is crouded up in a narrow room, where he hath not ſufficient room or ſpace for his body; thence by a <hi>metaphor</hi> it is uſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any affliction which beareth any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.35. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61091:103"/> 12.10. where it is tranſlated diſtreſſes. Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, we are indeed troubled on every ſide, but we are not <hi>ſtraitned as to our minds;</hi> we are impriſoned, but we have yet a liberty in our ſpirits, they are, and ſhall be free priſoners; thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. who ſang in their priſon at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Their bodies were in <hi>little eaſe,</hi> but their ſpirits were at great liberty; they were not ſtraitned in their own bowels. There is this Riddle opened; the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, being in trouble on every ſide, that referred to their outward man; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not in diſtreſs,</hi> that referred to their inward man, to their better part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond phraſe is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we tranſlate it, <hi>not in deſpair,</hi> that is, not wholly in deſpair. The Praepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this place increaſeth the ſignification of the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to which it is in this Text oppoſed; he had ſaid before, that they were in anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſuſpence, at uncertainties; but yet (ſaith he) not wholly at incertainties; we are at incertainty what God will do with us as to our bodies, liberties, or outward concerns; but we are at no incertainty what is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor what God will do with us as to our ſouls, as to our ſpiritual or eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third phraſe by which their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is expreſt, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, <hi>not forſaken.</hi> It is a decompound Verb; the ſimple Verb ſignifieth to leave, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, ſo doth the compound. <hi>Criticks</hi> ſay the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61091:104"/> 
                  <hi>Decompound</hi> here uſed, ſignifieth more, <hi>viz.</hi> to leave one in diſtreſs when he is in the greateſt danger. It is uſed by our Saviour hanging upon the Croſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.34. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16. <hi>All did forſake me, Heb.</hi> 10.25. 13.5. In all which places it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a leaving in diſtreſs, or in a time of danger. God's people ſhall not be left in time of danger. But this muſt be underſtood of God's ſpecial gracious preſence, reſpecting their inward man; for as to the preſence of his providence with reſpect to their more external concerns, they are often left.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth phraſe is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we tranſlate it, <hi>not deſtroyed,</hi> which indeed is the ordinary ſignification of it, and it never ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies leſs than <hi>dead;</hi> it often ſignifieth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction. We are (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>caſt down</hi> in our honour and reputation, and from the ſtation we have formerly had in the World, but we are not caſt into Hell, we are not yet killed, and caſt into the grave.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition then cometh to this; That God will not utterly caſt off and forſake his people, when they are in the greateſt dangers, and difficulties imaginable; he may ſeem to forſake them, he may withdraw from them ſomething of his providence which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore afforded them, but he will not wholly withdraw himſelf from them.</p>
               <p>This leadeth me (in the next place) to inquire what tokens of Gods preſence, and influences of God upon them, the People
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61091:104"/> of God have experienced, and may expect in the times of their greateſt dangers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Theſe are various, few or none poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have experienced all, and ſcarce any of Gods People but have experienced ſome or other of them, and may live in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them. I will inſtance in ſome few.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes they ſhall <hi>experience the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. Once have I ſpoken</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>&amp; twice have I heard it, that power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God.</hi> This power is inſeparable from the Divine Being, where-ever that is, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence muſt be, but as to the exerting of it this or that way, that dependeth upon the will of God. Man doth not neceſſarily, at all times, exert that power which is at all times in him, and natural to him, but governeth himſelf by his reaſon and wiſdom, in the uſe of his power. So doth God, ſometimes he is pleaſed not to ſhew forth what he could of his power, either in preſerving his People from the hands, or out of the hands of their Enemies, he hath wiſe ends, why he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to fall into their hands and to be overpowered by them. But ſometimes when they are in trouble they ſhall have the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the <hi>Divine Power,</hi> to keep them from deſtruction. The Angel of the Lord ſhall by night open the Priſon Doors, and let out the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.19. And knock off <hi>Peters</hi> chains, and carry him along with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.7. An Earthquake ſhall ariſe, the foundation of the priſon ſhall be ſhaken,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61091:105"/> and the Doors opened, and the Apoſtles bands ſhall be looſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.26. <hi>Elijahs</hi> enemies ſhall be ſmitten with blindneſs, and led into their Enemies City. God will <hi>make a way</hi> to eſcape the temptation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. God will ſometimes let his proudeſt enemies ſee and know, that wherein they talk, or act proudly, he will be above them. This particular appearance of God is not the object of our faith. It is but what God hath formerly done, and doth ſtill in ſome particular inſtances, but not what he hath by promiſe tied himſelf to do; thus the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the three Children in <hi>Daniel, Daniel</hi> himſelf were perſecuted, but not forſaken, as to the influence of the Divine power for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But God chuſeth not thus at all times to make his <hi>Power</hi> glorious. Sometimes he will make his <hi>wiſdom</hi> glorious, they ſhall ſeem to be forſaken as to his <hi>power,</hi> his arm ſhall not be made <hi>bare</hi> for them, but they ſhall experience the preſence of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and that two ways, 1 <hi>Sometimes taking the wiſe in their own craftineſs.</hi> Job 5.12, 13. <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot find their interpriſe, he taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs and the Counſel of the froward is carried head-long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Jews experienced the preſence of God in the caſe of <hi>Hamans</hi> conſpiracy to deſtroy them all. Infinite inſtances might be given of this in all ages. 2 Sometimes he will fit his people ſufficiently to deal with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61091:105"/> them, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.15. <hi>I will give you a mouth and wiſdom, which none of your Enemies ſhall be able to reſiſt.</hi> This was verified as to <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 6.20. Of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.20. That his adverſaries <hi>were not able to reſiſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Spirit, by which he ſpake.</hi> Hence Chriſt commanded his firſt diſciples that when their enemies ſhould <hi>deliver them up,</hi> they ſhould take no thought how, or, <hi>what they ſhould ſpeak, for it ſhould be given them in that ſame hour what they ſhould ſpeak.</hi> For (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you, Matth.</hi> 10.19, 20. This was eminently made good to the firſt and moſt famous Miniſters of the Goſpel, and hath in its meaſure been ſince made good in all ſucceeding ages, ſo as plain, illiterate, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant creatures, have been able to put to ſilence the wiſeſt and moſt learned of their proud, and cruel adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes the preſence of God is ſeen with his people in giving them a great <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>freedom of Spirit,</hi> ſo as they have not been <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſtraitned in their own bowels; they have been ſtraitned as to room for their bodies, ſhut up in cloſe priſons, but their Spirits have been at <hi>perfect liberty.</hi> This liberty of our Spirits is ſeen in a Well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, a ſatisfaction, and contentment with the will of God concerning us. So as we are never leſs in priſon then when we are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the Truth is, a priſon is nothing to him who hath his Soul and ſpirit at liberty.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61091:106"/> Thoſe who have read any <hi>Martyrologies</hi> have found inſtances enough of this, how many Servants of God have found in priſons, and under their great variety of ſufferings, the greateſt freedom of their Spirit, both for doing, and ſuffering, and from ſlaviſh fears imaginable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes they experience the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with them, giving them <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi> This was that <hi>boldneſs</hi> which the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> took notice of in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Acts</hi> 4.13. which made them marvel; and it is ſaid, that they <hi>took knowledge of them that they had been with Jeſus.</hi> God ſometimes will not let his people ſee his power, in delivering them from an evil, nor his wiſdom, in countermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Adverſaries; but they ſhall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience him making them couragious and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant</hi> in the ſpiritual fight, ſo as they ſhall not be afraid at what man can do unto them. Nothing deſtroyeth a man in ſufferings but ſlaviſh fears, and dejections; whiles the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a man holds, he can bear his infirmity; he may be caſt down, but he cannot be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You ſhall obſerve it in reading the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church, as recorded in holy writ, or in other Books, that it hath pleaſed God ſometimes to pick out ſome perſons to be his witneſſes to ſome Truths; with theſe now the preſence of God hath not been to cover them, and preſerve them from their Enemies, nor yet to deliver them, once faln into their hands, but giving them a mighty Spirit and courage to go thorough their ſufferings. For
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61091:106"/> this was the Apoſtles prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29. <hi>And now Lord, behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy Servants, that with all boldneſs they may speak thy word.</hi> This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s declar'd <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> and <hi>hope, Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That in nothing he ſhould be aſhamed; but that with all boldneſs</hi> (as always) <hi>ſo now, Chriſt ſhould be magnified in his body, whether by life or death.</hi> Such is reported to have been the courage of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when he heard the Sentence of condemnation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt him; <hi>He thanked God for it;</hi> and when the <hi>Proconſul</hi> would have had him to have deliberated upon it, he preſently and boldly replied, <hi>In re tam juſtâ nulla eſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi> there was no need of deliberation in ſo juſt and righteous a Cauſe. Such was the Spirit of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> threatned him with puniſhment, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pueris illa terriculamenta propone</hi> (ſaith he) Scare Children with thoſe Bugbears; you may take my life from me, but the confeſſion of the Truth you cannot take from me.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, (To name no more) ſometimes God's not <hi>forſaking his people,</hi> when they are perſecuted, appeareth in <hi>conſolatory influences.</hi> The conſolations of God in ſuch an hour are not ſmall with them. <hi>Stephen ſaw the glory of God, and Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> when the <hi>ſtones</hi> were flying about him to take away his life. Infinite almoſt are the ſtories that might be produced out of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory to this purpoſe. One (when the fire was put to the wood under him to burning) crying out, <hi>Methinks you ſtrew Roſes under my
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61091:107"/> feet.</hi> That of Mr. <hi>Samuel,</hi> who is reported to have had (the day before his death) one in <hi>white</hi> appearing to him, and bidding him <hi>be of good comfort, after that day he ſhould never hunger nor thirſt more.</hi> And that of <hi>Robert Glover,</hi> who is reported to have cried out to his <hi>Fellow-Martyr, O Auſtin! he is come, he is come.</hi> And that of <hi>Ridley</hi> to <hi>Latimer, Be of good comfort</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>God will either moderate the flames, or ſtrengthen us under them.</hi> But theſe ſtories are endleſs, and every where occurring in <hi>Eccleſiastical</hi> Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But will ſome ſay, <hi>May one that feareth God build upon this? and exerciſe a Faith in this experience of</hi> Paul, <hi>as having in it the force of a promiſe? Are there no inſtances of the Servants of God, who have been ſufferers for his Name ſake, and for Righteouſneſs ſake, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired and been forſaken?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. I anſwer; When we ſpeak of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing Faith,</hi> we muſt find ſome Word of God to be the object of that Faith; for tho God be the object of our Faith, yet we know nothing of God of this nature but in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Word. So as tho God be the primary and remote object, yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is the proximate object.</p>
               <p>Secondly; There are <hi>general</hi> promiſes of God's preſence with his people in danger; ſuch as that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the waters, I will be with thee, and thorow the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee; when thou walkeſt thorow the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Now
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61091:107"/> theſe are the objects of peoples Faith, and every Child of God may repoſe a ſure truſt and confidence in God, that they ſhall as to him be made good, and prove <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; For particular promiſes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving from dangers, or deliverance out of dangers, or comfort, or courage, it is enough if they be made good to any particular Souls, ſuppoſing the promiſe for deliverance one way or other, in one method or another, to hold ſure, we may well leave it to the good providence and wiſdom of God, how he will fulfil it, and make it good to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly; It is not poſſible that the ſame Servants of God ſhould every way experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the preſence of God with them: If he manifeſteth his preſence to his people in a way of power or wiſdom, preſerving them from dangers, or delivering them out of their Enemies hand, how ſhould he manifeſt his preſence in giving them a liberty of ſpirit, while they are in their cuſtody, or in giving them courage, or ballancing their afflictions with the conſolations of his Spirit? Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> exerciſed Faith no further than ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Either God will aſſwage the flame, or ſtrengthen us to bear it.</hi> All the people of God cannot exerciſe a particular Faith in God as to this or that manifeſtation of his preſence; but as to ſome influence which may amount to a deliverance of them from the evil, or from the <hi>Evil</hi> of the <hi>Evil</hi> they may.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; Nor is it impoſſible but there may be ſome particular inſtances of God's
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61091:108"/> people, (but thoſe very rare) whom God (for the puniſhment of their ſins) may have let fall, and abide into, and in their Enemies hands, and may not have found theſe manifeſtations of the Divine preſence either in the freedom of their ſpirits, or in a boldneſs or courage, nor yet in the conſolations of his Spirit; but if they go to Heaven, (as all ſuch ſhall,) tho' it be as thorow fire, they ſhall there certainly have his preſence, and in it joy, and fulneſs of joy, and that for evermore.</p>
               <p>I come now to make ſome practical appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the preceeding diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> 1. I ſhall begin with that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal which is to try you,</hi> as though <hi>ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you.</hi> The things that have been are, and ſhall be, and there is nothing new under the Sun. You cannot be the firſt who have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on every ſide, perplexed, perſecuted, caſt down. It is no new thing: There hath no temptation of this nature, there can no temptation befall you, but ſuch as is common to man, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.13. Ever ſince <hi>Cain</hi> roſe up againſt <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſlew him, becauſe he was more righteous then he, and offered up to God a more excellent Sacrifice; nay, ever ſince God put an <hi>Enmity between the ſeed of the Woman,</hi> and <hi>the ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> Gen. 3.15. this hath been in the World. <hi>So perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted they the Prophets, which were before you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. Trouble, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, perſecution are things ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61091:108"/> ſuch as Gods people are exempted from, that they are almoſt entailed to the preaching and profeſſion of the Goſpel. If you <hi>indure chaſtening God dealeth with you, as with ſons, for what Son is he whom the Father</hi> chaſteneth <hi>not</hi> (at leaſt with the <hi>rod of the wicked?) But and if you be without chaſtening.</hi> (whereof <hi>all are partakers, then are you Baſtards, and not Sons. Heb.</hi> 12.8, 9. Seeing then you have but neighbours fare, and indure no temptations but what are common to men, ſeeing you have but <hi>Godly mens</hi> fare, that the Prophets have been thus treated before you, ſeeing you have but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fare; for ſo they dealt with Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, ſeeing you have but the fare of the People and Children of God: Why ſhould you think it ſtrange if any ſuch thing ſhould happen to you, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>rejoyce in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13.

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> 3. <hi>See here the vaſt difference betwixt a Child of God and another man, in an hour of trial.</hi> Man as man is born to trouble, as naturally as ſparks fly upward: And though indeed there be ſome afflictions that are proper to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſuch as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the owning of the great Truths of it, or adhering to the Righteous ways preſcribed and directed in it; yet troubles do not bubble up only from this fountain, but from the generally debauch'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature of man, which renders <hi>hominem homini Lupum,</hi> every man an Enemy to his neighbour, and makes men like the Fiſh of the Sea, where the greater devour the leſs; or like <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which we ſee peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and butting one at another, though no cauſe be given. But that which this Text prompts us to obſerve, is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Child of God, and another man in the hour of trouble.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61091:109"/> Where is the difference? Hitherto all things fall alike to all men. Here's the difference, others, when they are troubled on every ſide, are diſtreſſed; when they are <hi>perplexed,</hi> they are <hi>in deſpair;</hi> when they are hunted and <hi>purſued,</hi> they are <hi>forſaken</hi> alſo; when they are caſt down, they are <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> the Child of God is not ſo: Let us ſee it in an inſtance; let us take that of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> There was a time when <hi>Saul</hi> was in trouble and diſtreſs enough. You have the ſtory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. where you find him repreſenting his own caſe to the Devil raiſed up by the Witch in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel.</hi> What ſaith he? <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſore diſtreſſed, for the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>make war againſt me, and God is departed from me, and anſwereth me no more, neither by Prophets, nor by Dreams.</hi> He was troubled on every ſide. Before him were the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and round about him; <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeth them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>He was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled;</hi> he was not troubled only, but diſtreſſed. Perplexed he was enough; he would never elſe have gone to a Witch, when <hi>v.</hi> 9. he had before cut off them who had familiar Spirits, and the Wizards out of the Land; but he was <hi>in despair.</hi> The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make war againſt me, and God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me.</hi> He was <hi>perſecuted,</hi> followed cloſe by the Army of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> but he was <hi>forſaken. God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is departed from me.</hi> Now let us look upon <hi>David</hi> in the 30th chapter of that Book, he was not in <hi>Saul</hi>'s circumſtances. <hi>Saul</hi> was the <hi>Actual
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61091:110"/> King,</hi> though was <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Anointed King</hi> to ſucceed him; he fled to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> but was turned off from him by the importunity of his Princes, <hi>chap.</hi> 29. he had but one poor City to hide his head in, and to make his retreat to, that was <hi>Ziklag.</hi> Whiles <hi>David</hi> was at <hi>Gath,</hi> the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had come, <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the South,</hi> and <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and had <hi>ſmitten Ziklag,</hi> and <hi>burnt it with fire,</hi> and <hi>had taken</hi> his Wives, and the Wives of his companions, the <hi>Women captives, and carried all away. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> comes, <hi>ch.</hi> 30. 3. and finds the City burnt, the Wives, Sons and Daughters that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and to his company, all taken captives, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>He was greatly diſtreſſed;</hi> for to all this was added another great evil, <hi>his people spake of ſtoning him.</hi> What doth <hi>David? v.</hi> 6. <hi>He incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Here was now one anſwering to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> troubled on every ſide, but not diſtreſſed: perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed. <hi>He incouraged himſelf in his God;</hi> is not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much caſt down, but is comforted; takes courage, and recovereth all again.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon lieth in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A wicked man hath no intereſt in God.</hi> He can in an hour of trouble cry out, <hi>O God,</hi> but he cannot cry out, <hi>My God.</hi> Nature teacheth men in hours of diſtreſs, that <hi>Affliction</hi> ſprings not out of the Earth, nor trouble out of the <hi>Dunghil;</hi> but there is a <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> who being offended, plagueth the children of men:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61091:110"/> Hence naturally the afflicted perſon calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God after one faſhion or another. The Mariners who were carrying <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh,</hi> in the Storm called each of them upon <hi>his God, Jonah</hi> 1. but the wicked man cannot ſay, <hi>My God;</hi> he cannot claim a Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, and relation unto God, ſo as he muſt be in diſtreſs, in deſpair, forſaken, deſtroyed at all ſuch times, when the help of man is <hi>vain;</hi> he cannot but think that in an hour of diſtreſs, God is ſaying to him, Now I am come to reckon with thee for all thy oaths, and curſes, and blaſphemies, by which thou haſt blaſphemed me; for all thy drunkenneſs and other debaucheries; now go to thy <hi>Luſts</hi> which thou haſt ſerved in deſpight of my Commandments, to the World, and to thy worldly Friends, and ſee if they be able to deliver thee out of my hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hath no true habits of <hi>Hope or Faith.</hi> There is indeed a God in the World, a God that is able to ſuccour people in all diſtreſſes, to relieve them in all troubles; but he hath neither any habit of true Hope, or Faith, by which he ſhould commit himſelf to this God, nor any object prepared for his Soul to caſt anchor upon; not a Promiſe in the whole Book of God that he can hope ſhould be made <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> to his Soul, for that he is without Chriſt, in whom all the Promiſes are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the godly man is not ſo; he is (upon this account) every way as happy as the other is miſerable; he is not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61091:111"/> from trouble than another man; yea, he is more expoſed to trouble; the World which loveth its own, hateth him, becauſe he is not of the World, but God hath choſen him out of the World, imprinted his Image upon him, markt him for his own. To look to be freed from trouble, is a mighty vain expectation; Man is born to it, Chriſtians indeed are more eſpecially as Sheep deſigned for the ſlaughter. A man cannot reaſonably wiſh, deſire or hope for a perfect immunity from diſtreſſes and troubles, becauſe it is not poſſible; ſo as the Child of God's happineſs lieth not there, that the fire ſhall not come nigh him; but here is his happineſs, that the fire ſhall not hurt, ſhall not conſume him. If he be thrown into the fire, God will be with him in the fire; if into the water, God will be with him in the water; the floods ſhall not drown him. When <hi>the Lord our God, the holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is our Saviour, Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. we ſhall not be <hi>in diſtreſs,</hi> nor <hi>in despair,</hi> nor <hi>forſaken,</hi> nor <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> Two things will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this <hi>Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That we are not afflicted from outward contingencies, but from ſome inward defects.</hi> Let a mans burden be never ſo heavy, if he hath but ſtrength enough to bear it, and to go away chearfully with it, it is no affliction to him; let a mans affliction be never ſo ſharp and ſmarting, if he hath but a conſolation that ballanceth it, it takes out the fire of it, and chaſeth away the grief and ſorrow of it; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſedneſs of ſpirit under a calamity, deſpair
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61091:111"/> and caſting away of hope, dejection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Spirits, ſtraitnings in our bowels, the being at a loſs in our own thoughts, what to do, which way to turn us, how to get out of our Net, theſe are the things that afflict us. Man is afflicted from the tumultuouſneſs and unquietneſs of his own thoughts; let thoſe be at reſt, and the affliction of all troubles is evaporated. What ſignified a priſon to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius,</hi> who could ſubſcribe a Letter, <hi>From the delectable Orchard of the</hi> Leonine <hi>priſon?</hi> or a Martyrs fire to <hi>James Bainham,</hi> (who burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fire) could cry out, <hi>O ye Papiſts! you look for Miracles, now ſee one; I feel no more pain, than if I were upon a Bed of Roſes.</hi> Or Death to <hi>Ann Askew,</hi> who being about to die, could ſubſcribe her Letter <hi>written by</hi> Ann Askew, <hi>who neither wiſheth Death, nor feareth it, and is as merry as one that is bound for Heaven.</hi> What ſignified the threat of ſtarving to <hi>Elizabeth Young,</hi> who had her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ready; <hi>If you take away my meat, God will take away my ſtomach.</hi> I give you but theſe few of many Inſtances, to prove that we are not afflicted from outward contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, ſo much as from ſome inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, had we but (like good men) learned to be <hi>ſatisfied from our ſelves,</hi> to be content that God ſhould chuſe our Lot for us, had we but learned <hi>in all eſtates to be content,</hi> and <hi>in all things to rejoyce,</hi> no outward contingency could afflict us; ſo that if God hath caſt his Salt into the bitter waters, which bubble up from our own ſpirits, as from a corrupt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61091:112"/> fountain, there would be nothing unclean, nothing bitter, nothing afflictive to us. Now if this be the ſtate of a Child of God, that when he is troubled on every ſide, he is not diſtreſſed in himſelf; when he is perplexed, he is not in deſpair; when he is perſecuted, he is not forſaken; our irregular paſſions are then corrected, the ſting of our deaths is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out; our deaths are ours; the <hi>Mercury</hi> is corrected, and prepared, and become me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal inſtead of being venemous. Our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſions are corrected either by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or by <hi>Grace;</hi> the firſt working to its due height, doth a great deal toward it. It were no hard matter to give you a multitude of Inſtances of Heathens in this caſe, from the operation of Moral Philoſophy: But alas! what is the force of that operation, compared with the operation of the Holy Spirit power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commanding, and bowing of our Souls to a compliance with the Divine Will, and commending to us the infinite Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the diſpenſations of Providence. O the felicity of a Child of God! if the Apoſtle hath in my Text given a true account of him, he ſwimmeth like Cork upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all afflictions, all troubles; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſink him; he lies like Flint in the fire of affliction, and is only purged, and made more clean and bright by it. Evils come to him, as the Prince of this World came to his Lord, but can do nothing againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they meet with nothing in him to make them bitter and heavy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:61091:112"/>2. Nay here is not all; Afflictions do not only not hurt him, but they prove of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great &amp; high advantage to him, he is not only not <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> but he is refined, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made more white, they are to him, as the refining pot for the ſilver and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for the Gold. He is not only <hi>not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,</hi> but his <hi>Tribulation worketh patience,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> experience, and <hi>experience hope,</hi> ſuch an hope as will not make his Soul aſhamed. He is not only not forſaken, but he ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never more experienceth the power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God, even the moſt high God. He is not only <hi>not deſtroyed,</hi> but <hi>through much tribulation he entereth into the Kingdom of God;</hi> his <hi>light and momentany afflictions work for him a far more eternal, and exceeding weight of Glory.</hi> And turn unto him for a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 13. But of this argument I may poſſibly ſpeak more hereafter.</p>

Fourthly, <hi>This diſcourſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vanity of wicked men, in troubling the People of God.</hi> On every ſide, perplexing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting them and caſting them down. They onely ſatisfy their malice, treaſure up to themſelves wrath, that's all. It is a pitiful fruit of an Enemies malice, if he cannot break ones Spirit, diſtreſs him, put him into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, deſtroy him. What did <hi>Julian</hi> get by all his rage when he was at laſt but put to it in a rage to throw his dagger up to Heaven and cry, <hi>Viciſti Galilaee,</hi> O thou Galilean, thou haſt overcome.

What did that bloody <hi>Biſhop Bonner</hi> get by all his rage, when he was forced at laſt to cry out, <hi>A vengeance on them! I think they love to burn.</hi> Nay their Vanity appeareth yet further in this, they cannot only not break their Spirits, or Spoil their joys, or hopes, but they commonly add to them, Chriſtians ordinarily never finding more peace, more joy in the Holy Ghoſt, more ſatisfaction in their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, more of the preſence of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are many that can ſay, before we were hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and perſecuted, we had more doubts, more fears, of our eternal ſtate, of the truth of our Spiritual habits, ſince we were thus hunted, God hath not ſo filled us with his terrors, we have not ſo many doubts, or fears, we live in a clear view of our own ſincerity, and we have learned leſs to go aſtray.</p>

Fifthly, this diſcourſe ought to quicken every one to inquire, whether he or ſhe be of thoſe who if they ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with the troubles mentioned in in this Text, yet might hope to meet with the relief, and ſupport of the Text. You will ſay to me, how ſhall we know that? I anſwer, if we wiſtly look upon what goeth before, and what followeth after in this Chapter, we ſhall find it no difficult matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what we may hope for in a day of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61091:113"/> trouble of this nature, 1. See <hi>v.</hi> 6. Theſe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of were ſuch, as <hi>that God who commandeth light to ſhine out of darkneſs, had ſhined into their hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God makes the light of the Knowledge of the glory of God to ſhine into mens hearts, for a double end. To ſhew them the truths of the Goſpel, and the way to everlaſting life that their own Souls may be ſaved in the day of Chriſt; hence enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, regenerated Souls who were once dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are ſaid to become <hi>light in the Lord, Eph.</hi> 5.8. 2. That they may communicate this light unto others either by Doctrine (which is the work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel) or by an holy and exemplary life, and converſation; upon which account as well others, as Miniſters are compared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. to a <hi>light</hi> lighted up in an houſe, and commanded that their light ſhould ſhine unto men, that <hi>men might ſee their good works,</hi> and <hi>glorify their Father which is in Heaven.</hi> This is not the priviledge of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only, but of the former alſo; perſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe Souls the light of the Goſpel hath ſhined, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, who have received Chriſt as their Saviour, believed in him, given up themſelves unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the moſt High ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty.</hi> Such as have choſen God for their God, Chriſt for their Saviour, as have ſaid of the Lord, <hi>he is my refuge and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61091:114"/> my God, in him I will truſt.</hi> Theſe are thoſe whom the Lord will deliver from the <hi>ſnare of the fouler,</hi> &amp;c. And of whom he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, they are ſuch as ſuffer <hi>in the exerciſe of that calling to which God hath called them. Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of ſuch as had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>Miniſtry, v.</hi> 1. and diſcharged it faithfully, <hi>not handling the Word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, v.</hi> 2. Such as <hi>preached not themſelves, but the Lord Jeſus, v.</hi> 5. God is preſent with men in their callings, not in their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, if good men will go out of their road they muſt not expect Gods company, or Chriſts preſence with them. But if they be in the way in which God hath ſet them, in the ſtation wherein God hath fixed them, and meet with <hi>trouble on every ſide,</hi> they may expect that they ſhall not be diſtreſſed, they ſhall not be <hi>in deſpair,</hi> they ſhall not be forſaken.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>To all.</hi> What an argument is here now to thoſe as are yet <hi>walking in the fleſh,</hi> running on in courſes of neglect, and contempt of God, that they would turn out of their roads of ſin and wickedneſs in hither, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by theſe things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him; no rational man can expect to live in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble, which way it ſhall come, or of what kind or nature it ſhall be, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but trouble waiteth for every man that lives in the World, ſome meet with more, ſome with leſs; ſome with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61091:115"/> trouble of one ſort, others with troubles of another ſort; all with ſome. No man No man muſt look to live without <hi>perplexity</hi> at one time or other. Natural wiſdom teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all to provide for the worſt; you ſay, the beſt will provide for it ſelf. There is no ſuch proviſion, as the getting an intereſt in God, and in Chriſt. Chriſt gathers his people <hi>as the hen gathers her chickens under her wings.</hi> Not only to cheriſh them, and keep them warm, but to protect them; when the kite cometh the chickens run under the hens wings. <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous ſhall flee unto it, and be at reſt. Prov.</hi> 18.10. Let thoſe that are at reſt and eaſe, in a wiſe proſpect of poſſible, yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain future troubles, turn into God, and get under his ſhadow. God is ſeldom a refuge and a tower to thoſe who have not choſen him to be ſo. Let thoſe that are in trouble, and perplexity yet at laſt be wiſe. It is not often that it is ſo, but happy is he whom trouble brings home to God as it did <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Better late then never, and our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God doth ſometimes extend his favour to thoſe who come late in to beg and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Let the happineſs of Gods people invite you to become ſharers with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with your ſelves, what but a God above can remain to a Man, or Woman when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are on every ſide?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But to conclude, <hi>This ſpeaketh to the people of God ſo to live, that this may be their portion.</hi> This is not ſo much the inſeparable
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61091:115"/> priviledge of a good man, but he may be without it. In anſwering the objection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came to the application of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I hinted to you, that it is poſſible that ſome particular perſons, who belong to God, may not find this Text verified in them in a day of trouble, but they ordinarily are ſuch as have been guilty of ſome looſe walking with God; and <hi>Azariah</hi> told <hi>Aſa,</hi> though a very holy man, that if he forſook God, God would forſake him. Let me therefore adviſe ſome few things, and ſo ſhut up this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed that you pull not trouble upon your ſelves.</hi> We never have any great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſuch troubles. This we may do, I mean, pull troubles upon our ſelves, either by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>walking,</hi> or by an imprudent, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet behaviour, <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth thoſe to whom he wrote, that they ſhould not <hi>ſuffer as evil doers,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15.

               <p>IN the 19th Chapter you ſhall find our Saviour having now almoſt finiſhed his courſe, going up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to the laſt Paſsover that he was at; in <hi>ch.</hi> 20. you read of ſeveral things he did there in the Temple. In the fifth verſe of this chapter you ſhall find that ſome of his Diſciples were taken with the brave ſtructure and ornaments of the Temple. Our Saviour <hi>v.</hi> 6. tells them; <hi>That as for thoſe things which they beheld, the days would come in which there ſhould not be left one ſtone upon another, that ſhould not be thrown down.</hi> This draweth out from the Diſciples a curious Queſtion; <hi>Maſter, but when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſign will there be when theſe things ſhall come to paſs? Matthew, ch.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 3. repeating the ſame ſtory, ſaith, that they ſaid unto him, <hi>Tell us, when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61091:120"/> of the end of the World?</hi> They make three Queſtions of it, enquiring about the certain time of the <hi>deſtruction of the Temple, Chriſt's coming,</hi> and the <hi>End of the World.</hi> This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Chriſt anſwers there, from the 4th <hi>v.</hi> to the end of the <hi>chapter;</hi> and in this chapter from <hi>v.</hi> 8. to <hi>v.</hi> 29. a great deal of pains is ſpent (and poſſibly to no ſatisfactory pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) by many Divines rightly to diſtribute theſe ſigns, and to tell us which of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (which happened within forty years after) and which related to the coming of Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the <hi>days of Pentecoſt;</hi> and which to the laſt Judgment yet to come. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. which can be applied to none but to the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem, When you ſhall ſee</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>encompaſſed about with Armies, then know that the deſolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is nigh.</hi> But for the generality of the ſigns given, I am of their mind, who judge that God intended <hi>in the deſtruction of</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>to ſhew</hi> a type of the deſtruction of the world, and that the ſame which our Saviour gave as ſigns of the one, he alſo gave as ſigns of the other, wars, and rumours of wars, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prodigious ſigns in the Heavens and the Earth, Earthquakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were great plenty of theſe before the dreadful deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and there will be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plenty of them before the laſt &amp; terrible day. Amongſt other ſigns he tells them, <hi>viz. That before all theſe,</hi> that is, before the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> and the <hi>terrible ſights,</hi> and the <hi>ſigns from
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61091:120"/> Heaven, they ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the Synagogues, and into Priſons,</hi> &amp;c. Then it followeth; <hi>And it ſhall turn to you for a teſtimony.</hi> The <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of the Text is obvious, the <hi>Subject</hi> of it lies in the preceding verſe, the <hi>Praedicate</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this verſe.</p>
               <p>Prop. <hi>The ſufferings of Chriſts Diſciples for his Names ſake, ſhall turn to them for a Teſtimony.</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> which is the only term (relating to the Subject) which needeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is this to ſuffer for Chriſt's Names ſake?</hi> We meet with the term of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>v</hi> 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.29. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſuffer for <hi>Chriſts Name ſake,</hi> is to ſuffer <hi>for him; for thy ſake are we killed all the day long, Rom.</hi> 8.36. It was their faſhion, to call Diſciples by their Maſters Names; thus the Heathens called <hi>Plato</hi>'s Diſciples, <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> or <hi>Platonicks;</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Diſciples, <hi>Ariſtotelians;</hi> hence Chriſt's Diſciples were called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Thus the term is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16. <hi>If any man
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61091:121"/> ſuffer as a Chriſtian.</hi> The very owning the Name and Doctrine of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the Doctrines of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> in thoſe firſt and furious times, was crime enough; there needed no more to bring a man in queſtion, yea, to bring him to his end, than for him to own himſelf one of the number of thoſe who were called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> the Chriſtians were accounted as a <hi>Sect,</hi> and a Sect every where ſpoken againſt. Thus <hi>John</hi> 15.21. <hi>All theſe things will they do unto you for my Names ſake,</hi> that is, for my ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſignifies <hi>any publication or profeſſion</hi> of the Goſpel, according to the place and ſtation wherein a man is ſet. Thus the Apoſtles of old, and the Miniſters of Chriſt now, who ſuffer for Preaching the Free Grace of Chriſt held forth, and offered to ſinners in the Goſpel, ſuffered for Chriſt's Name ſake. Thus the Apoſtles under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the term, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.28. when the Jewiſh Magiſtrates ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>Did not we ſtraitly command you that you ſhould not Teach in this Name? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you have filled</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>with your Doctrine,</hi> verſe 41. <hi>They departed from the Councel, rejoycing that they were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally; <hi>He who ſuffereth for any thing in the Worſhip of God, or in the practice of Holineſs,</hi> wherein he payeth an homage, and yieldeth an obedience to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and doth any thing <hi>eo nomine,</hi> upon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61091:121"/> that account, becauſe Chriſt hath required it of him, or forbeareth any thing, becauſe Chriſt hath forbidden, ſuffers for Chriſt's Names ſake, that is, for Chriſt for his Allegiance and Obedience unto him; for my Names ſake, is no more than <hi>for my ſake,</hi> upon <hi>my account,</hi> that you may keep any Commandment of mine. Hence theſe two things follow neceſſarily.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not neceſſary that thoſe who make men ſufferers for the ſake of Religion, ſhould openly profeſs that they make them to ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt's ſake;</hi> they may do the thing, though perhaps they may think they do it not, or at leaſt may not think fit to proclaim their own ſhame. For men to ſuffer for Chriſt's Names ſake, is <hi>Perſecution;</hi> the guilt of which doth not depend upon mens thinkings, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own acts. The Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and after them the Pagans, verily thought they ought to do many things <hi>againſt Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, and therefore made no difficulty of an open owning their cruel and barbarous actions under this notion. But ſince thoſe two firſt broods of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution have been worn out of the World, there have none riſen up confident enough to approve their ſayings, and do like unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is it neceſſary to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one <hi>perſecuted,</hi> that he <hi>ſhould be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer for not obeying ſome precepts of man.</hi> Nor will all ſuch precepts either diſcharge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61091:122"/> from the guilt of Perſecution, or bring thoſe that diſobey them, out of the notion of perſons perſecuted; if it would, the Apoſtles ſuffering as evil doers, had had no cauſe to have gone from the Council, rejoycing that they were thought worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. after they had been ſtrictly commanded, that they ſhould not Teach in his Name. But whatever other men may judge for any Man or Woman to ſuffer for owning Chriſt, or publiſhing the Grace of the Goſpel, or living up to the Rule of it, is to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But my great buſineſs is to open the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate in the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and to ſhew you how ſuch kind of ſuffering ſhall turn to God's people for a Teſtimony. I ſhall open this under theſe two Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſhall turn to a Teſtimony on God's part towards them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſhall be a Teſtimony on their part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</hi> I ſhall open both theſe in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhall be a <hi>Teſtimony on God's part to them.</hi> 1. <hi>Of a great honour which God putteth upon them;</hi> this the Apoſtles underſtood, tho our ſenſe underſtandeth it not; therefore it is ſaid, that they went away from the Councel, rejoycing that they were thought <hi>worthy</hi> to ſuffer ſhame for his Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. When the <hi>Perſian Emperour</hi> asked <hi>Haman</hi> his Favourite, <hi>What ſhould be done to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61091:122"/> the man whom the King delighted to honour?</hi> If a <hi>man</hi> maketh anſwer, <hi>Eſther</hi> 6.8. <hi>Let the Royal Apparel be brought which the King uſeth to wear, and the Horſe the King rideth upon, and the Crown Royal which is ſet upon his head, and let this Apparel and Horſe be delivered to the hand of one of the Kings moſt Noble Princes, that they may array the man withal whom the King delighteth to honour, and bring him on horſeback through the Streets of the City, and proclaim before him, Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour. And the King ſaid to</hi> Haman, <hi>make haſte, and take the Apparel, and the Horſe, and do even ſo to</hi> Mordecai <hi>the Jew.</hi> But God takes a qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e contrary method; Is there a man whom the King of Kings hath a mind to honour? Let (ſaith he) the Crown of Thorns be brought forth, which my only begotten Son wore when he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in humane fleſh, and let that be ſet on his head; and let the Scarlet Robe be brought forth, which they put upon my Son in deriſion, a little before his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and let that be upon him, and let him be ſcourged with the Whip with which he was ſcourged, and the Gall and Vinegar that was given him to drink, and let a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of miſcreants deride and ſcoff him; let the hands that buffeted my Son buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him, and proclaim this before him; <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the God of Heaven delighteth to honour. Paul</hi> was one whom God delighted to honour.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61091:123"/> Thou ſhalt, ſaith he, be a <hi>Witneſs</hi> unto all men: A <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and a <hi>Witneſs.</hi> It is true, as <hi>Miniſters</hi> men are <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> but a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer is an eminent Witneſs; he is not a meer verbal Witneſs. Hence the Antients were wont to call ſuffering, <hi>The Crown of Martyrdom;</hi> and ſome ſay that <hi>Stephen</hi> had his name predictive of this. We read in our <hi>Martyrologies</hi> of a <hi>Female Martyr,</hi> who having a Child in her arms, ſeeing ſome Martyrs ſuffering, in haſte gave it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and offer'd her ſelf to be a <hi>Martyr,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Crowns are not to be diſtributed every day.</hi> Amongſt men he counteth himſelf mightily honoured, whom the King will make choice of to be his Champion. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſufferer for Chriſt is his Champion. What ſhall we think of that man whom God picks out of a whole Pariſh, a whole City, to be a Champion for him. It is ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi> (that great Inſtrument of God) that in a Letter to ſome perſons condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die, he thus preferred them before himſelf. I have made (ſaith he) a great deal of buſtle in the World, and done a great deal of work for God; but God hath not yet done me the honour to ſuffer for him. It is an honour to be choſen as a Second to Chriſt, in incountring the World. It is not only a Teſtimony that God loveth and favoureth ſuch a man, but it is a Teſtimony that God hath put an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon him, and made him one of his firſt threes; ſuch honour have not all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61091:123"/> his Saints; but thoſe that have it are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a Teſtimony of great Influences of grace and favour, with which God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will bleſs them.</hi> 1. I ſay of <hi>great Influences of Grace, with which God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them.</hi> God doth not uſe to cull out young Souldiers to this Combate, they are uſually <hi>veterani;</hi> he will not put new Wine into old Bottles, leſt they break; he will not have tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is no Soul more jealous of it ſelf, than that Chriſtian who is moſt ſincere. When God calleth ſuch a one out to ſuffer for his Name, it is a ſign that he hath more Faith, more Courage, than he judged himſelf to have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo a further <hi>Sign</hi> or Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to them of ſome further Influences of grace with which God deſigneth them. God's priſoners uſe not to live upon their own charge. As great and Noble Princes uſe to maintain their priſoners with Bread and Water; ſo the great God maintains thoſe that are in ſufferings for his ſake, with Divine Influences proportioned to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61091:124"/> their wants. What theſe Influences are, I have heretofore ſhewed you upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text. One ſhall have Wiſdom, which the Adverſaries ſhall not be able to reſiſt; another ſhall have an inward Strength and Courage; a third ſhall have the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of Grace; and that which may confirm us in this, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſe of God, as never to leave nor forſake his people, ſo more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be with them, when they paſs through the Waters, and through the Fires; ſo as the Waters ſhall not drown them, nor the Fires kindle upon them; but alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the honour and glory of God in the caſe. It is not for God's honour that his Combatants ſhould fail. No man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Battel at his own charge, is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently true of the <hi>good fight</hi> of thoſe that fight the Lord's Battels, not with fleſhly weapons, but ſuch as are ſpiritual; ſuch as God armeth the Soul with in its ſtrivings againſt ſin. So that as a Child of God may at all times build upon that ſure promiſe, <hi>I will never leave you, nor forſake you;</hi> and upon the credit of it have its converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at all times, without covetouſneſs; ſo he may eſpecially build upon it at a time when God calleth him out to ſuffer for his Names ſake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſuffering is a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> on Gods part towards them, <hi>of a great reward, which they ſhall receive from God eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

I have particularly heard it obſerved of thoſe <hi>Walloons,</hi> who left their country, and fled hither in the time of D' <hi>Alva's</hi> rage in <hi>Flanders.</hi> So that often times God giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth manifold more in this life then they loſe for his ſake, much more ſenſible comforts: But oftner he gives them an <hi>hundred fold with perſecutions,</hi> that is, if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their perſecutions, they weigh the conſolations they have from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; if they ſet the one againſt the other; or weigh the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are manifold more. And this is that which the Apoſtle experienced, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> The ſum is, ſufferings for the name of Chriſt are a Teſtimony or a <hi>Token</hi> to thoſe that ſuffer, of great rewards which God hath deſigned them, and prepared for them, either in this life, or in that life which is to come. In this life either <hi>with perſecutions,</hi> mixing their bitter cups with the Sweet conſolations of his holy and bleſſed Spirit to that degree, that the ſweet taſt ſhall drown the bitter taſt, and they ſhall have no taſt of the <hi>wormwood,</hi> and the gall. Or when the perſecutions are over (for, <hi>Nubeculae ſunt &amp; tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt,</hi> they are but ſtorms, and will go
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61091:126"/> over) repairing their loſſes, building them up fairer houſes then the fire hath burnt, and giving them better eſtates then they have loſt: Or in the life to come giving them (as the Apoſtle calleth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory; for I reckon,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.) <hi>That the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. They are a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> on Gods part to thoſe that ſuffer, <hi>That the Lord will deſtroy their enemies.</hi> Thus <hi>Stella</hi> expoundeth this Text. <hi>Quod illi impiè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra vos egerunt, &amp; juſte damnentur;</hi> That they have dealt unjuſtly, and wickedly with you, and ſhall juſtly be condemned. This is that which the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>So that we our ſelves glory in you, in the Churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your perſecutions, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, that you indure, which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt taken of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, for which ye ſuffer.</hi> Mark ye! There is one thing of which it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token, but then it followeth. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi> It is a manifeſt token of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Now the reaſon of this lyeth in the heinous nature of this ſin, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily <hi>goeth before unto Judgment.</hi> And is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a mortal ſign in every Soul
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61091:126"/> where it is found. A Soul may be ſick of luſts of the fleſh, ſick of intemperance in eating and drinking, ſick of incontinence, filthy luſts and uncleanneſs, ſick of other luſts, and yet through grace may recover; ſuch were ſome of you (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) but now you are <hi>waſhed.</hi> But it is very rare that a Soul is <hi>ſick</hi> of rage and malice againſt Chriſt, and his name and goſpel, ſo as it breaks out in overt acts; I ſay it is very rarely that it recovers. This diſeaſe of rage and malice againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, which is ſeen in mens dealings with the publiſhers, and profeſſors of it, is much like that diſeaſe in the body which they call a <hi>Cancer,</hi> which may lurk a great while, and the perſon may live ſo long as he can keep it from breaking, but if it once breaketh there is very little hope of long life. God according to his infinite patience beareth a long time with theſe <hi>veſſels</hi> of wrath fitted for deſtruction; there are thouſands in the World, who have this cancerous humour within them who are full of wrath, malice and rage, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Chriſt and his Goſpel, but they keep it from breaking out into overt-acts, they will think ill enough of God, and Chriſt, and his ways, and ſometimes they will alſo talk hardly enough; theſe may live to an old Age, and go down to their Graves in an external peace, having no bands in their death: <hi>Their ſins</hi> ſhall follow after them,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61091:127"/> after their lives to judgment, for <hi>Jude</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us that the <hi>Lord will come with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, and to convince all that are ungoldly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ongſt them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> But if mens rage break out openly, God ordinarily is more quick with them. There are ſome of thoſe <hi>blood-thirſty,</hi> and <hi>deceitful men</hi> which he hath ſaid ſhall not live out half their days. It is ſeldom that God lets paſs acts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent injuſtice, and cruelty. But that he in this life meeteth with the actors of it, and with the ſame meaſure which they mete unto others it is meted to them again. But now perſecution is the higheſt <hi>ſpecies</hi> of injuſtice, for in it there is not only a <hi>wrong</hi> done to another, that which is not due is given to him, but God is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned in the caſe, the wrong is done to him for Gods ſake; he is abuſed, impriſoned, his eſtate is taken from him, he is impriſoned, tormented, put to death for Gods ſake, becauſe he will own his truths, walk in his ways, do what he commandeth him. It is the ſin that fills up the meaſure of iniquity to, and in a Soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.32. <hi>Fill ye up then the meaſure of your Fathers.</hi> Nay more then this, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 35. there, <hi>That upon you may come all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, ſhed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous</hi> Abel <hi>unto the blood of</hi> Zecharias
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61091:127"/> 
                  <hi>the Son of</hi> Barachias. It draweth upon men the ſins of the ſame kind committed by their forefathers, and not reckoned for it ſheweth, that if they had lived in the days of their <hi>forefathers,</hi> they would have done what they did; they inherit their Spirit. Hence you ſhall obſerve, that although in eccleſiaſtical ſtory we read of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that laſted a long time, yet we read of very few particular perſons, that were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſecutors that laſted long. When this <hi>Cancer</hi> hath broke out they ſeldom live long. Gods patience often extends to <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,</hi> and <hi>Whoremongers,</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> and <hi>Curſers,</hi> and they often die in the times of other men, and after the manner of other men; they do injury to few but themſelves; they ſhew indeed a contempt of God, and a diſobedience to God, but they do not ſhew a rage and malice againſt God; their ſins do not tend to blot out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt, and to root out the name of God from the Earth. But he is not ſo patient with this blackeſt ſort of ſinners; they do harm to others, yea to thoſe of whom God hath ſaid, <hi>He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine Eye.</hi> They are for rooting out the name, and mention of God from the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God will not bear with theſe, there ſhall be ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in their death, either they ſhall dye in their youth, whiles yet their bones are full of marrow, or they ſhall not dye the ordinary deaths of men. They ſhall
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61091:128"/> not come into the grave <hi>as a ſhock of corn in its ſeaſon,</hi> but be weeded out, and cut up before the harveſt. If I durſt wiſh evil to to him that hated me, I would curſe him in the name of the Lord; I would ſay let him be a perſecutor of others for Chriſts name ſake. Make but your own obſervation if you have known, or do or ſhall know any ſuch. So that this ſin where-ever the guilt of it doth ſtick is an evident token, not only of eternal perdition to the adverſaries of Chriſt and his Goſpel, but an ordinary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a deſtruction in this life. Thus I have ſhewed, how the ſufferings of Gods people turn unto them for a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> on Gods part, let me ſhew you in the next, place, how they turn unto them for a Teſtimony on their part towards God. I will open that in five particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are a Teſtimony of their <hi>Diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> This is a part of the ſenſe that <hi>Stella</hi> giveth of it; <hi>Eveniet vobis in ſignum, &amp; atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtationem, quod vere diſcipuli mei fideliſſimi eſtis.</hi> All thoſe that follow a teacher, under a ſhew, or pretence of learning from him, are in common phraſe and way of ſpeaking cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his diſciples; ſo it was with Chriſt, while he was on Earth he had ſome that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him for the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ves, ſome that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, but he committed not himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24. Theſe were diſciples <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in an outward appearance, they looked like diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61091:128"/> but indeed were not. <hi>He hath others</hi> who are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his diſciples indeed. None is a <hi>Diſciple indeed</hi> to another, who doth not really and actually learn of him, either from his words, or from his example in his life and converſation. What ſaith our Saviour? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Obſerve it, <hi>Take up his Croſs.</hi> It is a great Teſtimony that a man is Chriſts <hi>Diſciple,</hi> not in name and outward profeſſion only, but in reality, when he can take up his Croſs. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that after all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he ſaid, <hi>Now begin I to be a Diſciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It will be a Teſtimony of their Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, and conformity to him.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>That we are predeſtinated, that we might be conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> There is the <hi>Image of a living Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Image of a dying Chriſt.</hi> The Image of a living Chriſt is in <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs, Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. Thus the holy man is conformed to the Image of Chriſt; but then there is the <hi>Image of a dying Chriſt.</hi> We are conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Image of Chriſt only by ſuffering. The Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. That he might know <hi>the fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings, and be made conformable unto his death.</hi> It is true, we are made conformable to the death of Chriſt in a meaſure, when we die unto ſin, as he died for ſin, ſo we die to ſin;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61091:129"/> this is an inward, ſpiritual conformity, which we come to by <hi>mortification;</hi> but there is alſo a more external, obvious conformity to the death of Chriſt, and that is, as he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtriving againſt ſin, and bearing a witneſs to the Truth, ſo we alſo ſuffer bearing a Teſtimony to Truth, and ſtriving againſt ſin; this we never arrive at till we come to be ſufferers, and our ſuffering upon theſe ſingle accounts, turn to us for a Teſtimony of ſuch our conformity to Chriſt. Yea, it is a Teſtimony of our Memberſhip in and with Chriſt. Chriſt is the Head of the Church, which is the Body, and we are ſaid to be Members of Chriſt, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alſo one of another. You have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodys ſake, which is the Church.</hi> That which <hi>is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt.</hi> Is there any thing behind of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Hath he not ſuffered, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glory, where he is impaſſible, living with, and unto God, where he can ſuffer and die no more? The ſufferings of Chriſt are to be conſidered in a double notion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>Expiatory</hi> or <hi>Exemplary.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as <hi>Expiatory,</hi> there is nothing of them behind, nothing of them to be filled up. He ſaid upon the Croſs, <hi>All is finiſhed.</hi> And he trod the Wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath alone; there was none of the people with him. But if you conſider them as they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61091:129"/> were <hi>Exemplary,</hi> as he <hi>ſuffered,</hi> ſetting us an example; ſo there is much of the <hi>Afflictions</hi> of Chriſt to be <hi>filled up;</hi> and they are to be filled up in the bodies of his Saints. Or elſe thus; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is taken perſonally or <hi>myſtically.</hi> Chriſt myſtically is the Church, he the Head, Believers Members, both making but one body, and that his body which is the Church. Now of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (taken in this ſenſe) much of his <hi>Afflictions</hi> are to be filled up. And Chriſtians ſuffering in conformity to Chriſt, is a Teſtimony to them that they are <hi>Members</hi> of an afflicted Chriſt; yea and alſo that they are Members of that body, of which Chriſt is the Head; for in all Ages it hath been the Lot of thoſe who would live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, to ſuffer perſecution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It turns unto a Teſtimony to them, <hi>both of the truth, and of the ſtrength of their Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle deſcribing Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. calleth it the evidence of things not ſeen, the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>What a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for?</hi> Many talk of Faith, few underſtand it. The work of Faith lies in a being perſuaded of God, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God for the things which we do not ſee. Now it is the want of this Faith which makes men ſhrink in a day of Trial. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>ch.</hi> 11.13, 14, 16. concludes from the Servants of God (of whom he there ſpeaks) <hi>taking joyfully the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61091:130"/> ſpoiling of their goods; that they knew in themſelves that they had in Heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> And from their confeſſing that they were Strangers and Pilgrims upon the Earth, that they <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared that they ſought a Country,</hi> and deſired a better Country, that is, an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. Mens unwillingneſs to ſuffer the loſs of any thing, that ſhall be made up with ſo great advantage, ſpeaketh them at leaſt weak in Faith, and but faintly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of that better ſtate; and that they find a difficulty to depend upon God's Word for it. But when men can freely for the Name of Chriſt leave their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and go into Baniſhment, part with their Eſtates, and be content to be ſtript of all they have, part with their Liberty, and be content with a Priſon; part with their Lives, and bid Death, even a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and moſt ignominious Death, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, it argueth that they both truly and ſtrongly believe what God hath revealed concerning a better Country, a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during Subſtance, the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, a life everlaſting, and full of glory; and not only that they are perſuaded of the truth of the things, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and rely upon God, and by hope pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently wait upon God for the beſtowing theſe things upon them, and making them their portion. Now what would not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good Chriſtian give for an Evidence of the truth and reality of his Faith? How
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61091:130"/> many doubts, how many fears hath he oft times about it! An ability to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt mightily tends to their confirmation. The Apoſtle therefore put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them together, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given on the behalf of Chriſt, not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Suffering, a freedom to ſuffer is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Faith, both to our ſelves, and alſo to others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will be a Teſtimony to the people of God of their <hi>Love to him.</hi> True Faith worketh by Love. Love to another is diſcerned in nothing more than in ſuffering for them; and indeed this is the heighth of Love. It ſpeaks a Soul to have diſcerned a great excellency in Chriſt, and in heart to cleave to him, that rather than part with him, will ſuffer the loſs of any thing. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account among the Heathens is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Love of <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes, Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Pirithous,</hi> &amp;c. But ſee it in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I account all things but loſs for the excellency of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> The Soul that may have had its doubts and fears whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it loveth Chriſt or no, meaſuring its affections to this ſpiritual, inviſible Object, by the motions of its affections to Objects more ſenſible, (which indeed is not a true and juſt meaſure) can doubt no longer,

                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:61091:134"/> when once the Lord hath enabled the Soul to ſuffer for his Name ſake, it ſpeaks a Soul to love Chriſt more than all ſenſible things, when to ſerve and enioy him, it hath freely parted with whatever it had of ſenſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and ſatisfaction. Nothing ſpeaks Love like a deep ſuffering for the Object beloved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham) I know that thou feareſt God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thine only Son from me.</hi> That term of <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>fearing God,</hi> in the Old Teſtament, hath often a larger ſenſe, than as ſignifying that paſſion which we call fear.

               <p n="5">5. Laſtly; It will be to a Soul not only a Teſtimony of Faith and Love, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Perſeverance, and Conſtancy, Steadineſs and Unmoveableneſs in the work of the Lord, but it will be alſo a Teſtimony of the <hi>Soul</hi>'s <hi>Zeal for God.</hi> Zeal is rather the intention of all the affections, than a particular affection of it ſelf.

               <p n="6">6. To theſe I may add one thing more. Suffering for the Name of Chriſt is a <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61091:134"/> of the preſence of God with the Soul.</hi> The Three Childrens <hi>induring the fiery Furnace,</hi> was a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of a fourth perſons being with them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s being in <hi>the Den of Lions,</hi> and induring that danger, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for a Teſtimony of God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence with him, and ſending his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to ſtop the mouths of the Lions. <hi>Paul</hi>'s couragious ſuffering was a Teſtimony to him that the <hi>Lord ſtood by him, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61091:135"/> let not arrogancy come out of your mouths, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. The Bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that ſtumbled are girt with ſtrength.</hi> Sinners out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Enmity to Chriſt, are ready to <hi>talk proudly</hi> by their threats, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) <hi>Acts</hi> 4.29. <hi>Behold their threats,</hi> and to <hi>act cruelly</hi> and <hi>barbarouſly.</hi> Every wiſe man propoundeth to himſelf an end of his actions, and doth nothing but for ſome end, that ſhall be worthy of his pains; not willing to labour in vain, and to bring forth nothing but trouble and ſorrow. The <hi>Actions</hi> as to which I am diſcouraging you, and from which I am dehorting you, are thoſe mentioned in the verſe before my Text; <hi>laying hands</hi> upon the people of God, perſecuting them, <hi>delivering them into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>Chriſt's Names ſake.</hi> I would willingly have all men think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what their End of ſuch actions is. It is one of theſe two, either that themſelves may live <hi>alone in the Earth,</hi> and enjoy their ſenſual ſatisfactions without diſturbance, and the ſenſible enjoyments of the World without any Rivals, or Competitors: Or elſe that they might ruine the Intereſt of God in the World. Now, admitting that to be a truth which you have heard, that theſe ſufferings ſhall be a <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> turn for a Teſtimony, none of theſe Ends are fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. If they be a Teſtimony, and ſhall turn to God's people for a Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61091:136"/> the <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> they are not like by ſuch actions to advance themſelves, by actions which are <hi>evident tokens</hi> of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, both a ſudden deſtruction here, and an eternal deſtruction hereafter. There are two bodies of people, of which no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be given, but that God after a ſhort time that he hath made uſe of them for his purpoſe, he hath deſtroyed them. The firſt are Armies, the ſecond are Bands and Troops of Perſecutors; there hath been ſome of theſe in all times, ſome need of them, God, the wiſe God, in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, hath had occaſion to make uſe of them. You ſhall obſerve, that the generality of theſe bodies are uſually made up of the dregs of Mankind. God hath often uſed them, but they have never laſted long; of all bodies of people, they have been the moſt mutable, periſhing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The firſt are uſually guilty of much blood and cruelty, (for it is an hard thing for men with their Swords in their hands, to keep from ſmiting but where the Lord bids them ſmite.) The latter are guilty of <hi>blood</hi> mingled with rage and malice againſt what is ſupremely good, their rage is againſt Heaven, and they at laſt find it hard to kick againſt the pricks. So far is the Perſecutor in reaching his ends, in advancing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up himſelf, that he finds he hath taken the next courſe to ruine and deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Look back upon the Records of time; you read in Holy Writ of ſeveral Troops
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61091:136"/> of Perſecutors; The Jews, Where are they? They were the firſt owners of the Field of Blood; they are ſcattered, and Vagabonds over all the Earth. The <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> thoſe I mean that ruled it, were the next. Where are thoſe great Powers that were a terrour to all the World? The ſtump of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire remaineth in <hi>Germany,</hi> that is, all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are yet in play, but God hath broken them in many places. What is become of all the Generation of thoſe in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days? <hi>Gardiner</hi> was ſoon cut off in his wickedneſs; <hi>Bonner</hi> buried upon a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. I do but name ſome things to you, leaving it to you to look back and ſee where you can find that there hath been any Troop or Band of Perſecutors, that God in a ſhort time hath not ſcattered by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and broken, or any ſingle perſon almoſt, who hath been eminent in theſe Atchievements, that hath died an old man, and full of days, and gone with peace to his Grave. Tell me who ever proſpered in this Trade? When the Devil thus entreth into a man, it is a Teſtimony that God is about to deſtroy him, and that his Judgment is not far off. What is it then that a man in ſuch actions ſhould propound to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the end? Is it the rooting out of Truth, the doing of a miſchief to the people of God whom he hateth? Alas! neither of theſe ends are practicable or feaſible. The ſufferings of God's people have always rooted and confirmed the Truths of God;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61091:137"/> the Truths of the Goſpel have got as much confirmation by the ſteady ſufferings of the people of God in the defence of them, as they have done by the Preaching of them. Three things have mightily contributed to ſettle mens minds in the Truth, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the <hi>Knowledge, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of it: The Preaching of the Goſpel by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſince by the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel. The miraculous operations, by which the firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel confirmed their Divine Miſſion. 3. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, couragious ſufferings of God's people. Miracles quickly ceaſed, while they were wrought, but few ſaw the operation of them; others then, we ſince have but had the report of them. The great things that have propagated Truth, the Truths of the Goſpel, have been Preaching and Suffering; the Preaching of Miniſters, and the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings both of Miniſters and People. Thoſe who have not Faith enough to believe the Scripture (upon their belief of which hangs all the credit of the Miracles we there read of) yet have had ſenſe enough to diſcern men dying with boldneſs and courage in a ſteady owning of the Propoſitions of the Goſpel. And it is natural to us to think there is ſomething of truth in thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, in the defence of which men will adventure to die, and loſe all their ſenſible enjoyments. What do men then aim at? Would they do a miſchief to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and do they miſtake the Miniſters of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61091:137"/> the Goſpel, and ſuch as fear God for ſuch? Alas! neither can they reach this end. Their ſufferings turn to them for a <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> a Teſtimony from God to them, of an honour he puts upon them, great grace which he hath beſtowed, and will yet further beſtow upon them, an exceeding great reward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their ſufferings, or after their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; either in this life, or in the life which is to come. Why then do people rage? Why do they imagine a vain thing? O that I could perſuade them to ſound a retreat from this Battel, which cannot but end in their own ruine, and their Enemies Victory.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But I hear ſome ſaying, Is there any that would go about to make men ſuffer for Chriſts Names ſake? May not men be made ſufferers for their diſobedience to the Laws of the place where they live, but they muſt ſuffer for Chriſt's Names ſake?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, God forbid, that <hi>Chriſts name</hi> ſhould be made uſe of by any who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to him to patronize, <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Rebellion</hi> or any diſturbance of the <hi>Civil Order or Peace.</hi> Nay, men radically good, may for ought I know ſuffer as <hi>evil-doers.</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> had been made to ſuffer for drawing out the Sword, and cutting off <hi>Malchus his ear,</hi> I know none could have defended him, it is not like his maſter would, who reproved him for it, and told him, That thoſe who <hi>took the ſword ſhould
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61091:138"/> periſh by the ſword.</hi> Chriſt did not juſtfy that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as done for his <hi>names ſake,</hi> tho it was <hi>for his ſake,</hi> yet it was ſpoiled by the raſhneſs and diſorderlineſs of it, and the want of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do what he did; the doing of an action for Chriſts name ſake ſignifyeth the doing it at his command, and by his order as well as for his honour and glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All innocent ſuffering is not a ſuffering for Chriſts name ſake.</hi> A man ſuffereth innocently, when he ſuffereth for a pretended crime of which he is not guilty, when men lay to their charge things which they know not; but every one who thus ſuffereth, ſuffereth not for Chriſts name ſake; <hi>Naboth</hi> was put to death upon a falſe ſubornation, but he was no ſufferer for Gods ſake, but for his own juſt rights and liberties. Indeed all ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to take heed, that they be no cauſes nor inſtruments of, and in mens ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering innocently, for it is a dreadful guilt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.8.15.5.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I told you before, that a ſuffering for <hi>Chriſts name ſake</hi> muſt be a ſuffering for him, not meerly for our ſelves, in defending our
